Abstract = {{In the Great Lakes basin, round gobies (Neogobius melanostomus) were
   first reported from the St. Clair River in 1990. Reported here are the
   details of range extension and establishment of round gobies in eastern
   Lake Michigan at Grand Haven, Michigan and in northern Green Bay, at
   Escanaba, Michigan. Round gobies were first collected in survey, samples
   at Grand Haven in 1997 (0.0 to 0.5 fish per trawl hour). Catch rates
   increased in 1998 (1.5 to 3.0 fish/h) and 1999 (38.0 to 69.0 fish/h).
   Individuals collected by, trawling (N = 207) ranged in total length from
   18 to 94 mm. Round gobies were first collected in survey (trawl) samples
   at Escanaba in 1998 (7.5 fish/h; total length range 43 to 58 mm). Round
   gobies were also collected during 1999 in trawls at Muskegon and in gill
   nets at Grand Haven and Saugatuck. No round gobies were collected at
   five other eastern Lake Michigan ports sampled during this same time
   period (1995 to 1999). Numerous adult round gobies were captured by,
   anglers at Grand Haven and Escanaba, indicating that these populations
   had been established for some time prior to being detected in survey
   sampling. Additional populations were verified from angler reports at
   Charlevoix (1998) and Kipling (1999), Michigan. Round gobies collected
   by anglers were generally larger, and taken in areas that are difficult
   to sample using conventional inshore sampling gear. These results
   indicate that survey and angler samples are complementary, but that
   up-to-date angler reports of exotic species that bite readily (round
   gobies) or are otherwise collected by anglers (Bythotrephes
   cederstroemi, Cercopagis pengoi) are critical to tracking the spread of
   these organisms.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of 25 allozyme loci in up to 469 Common Buzzards (B. b,
   buteo) from five locations in Germany revealed allelic polymorphism at
   twelve loci, but a prevalence of rare alleles resulted in a very low
   heterozygosity of H-0 = 0.0057. This rather low level of genetic
   variation characterizes a most abundant raptor species with highly
   polymorphic plumage pigmentation. The results of monitoring 571 buzzard
   breeding pairs from the Hakel forest (Sachsen-Anhalt) over 27 years
   indicate that neither the among-pair fertility variance, which slightly
   increased the genetically effective population size against the
   numerical size, nor the yearwise fluctuation of the breeder numbers, nor
   other population ecological characters were likely to erode the genetic
   variation of the numerically large buzzard population. One or repeated
   phyletic or historical bottle-necks are postulated to have diminished
   the allozyme variability, and at the same time to have created new
   genetic variance of the pigment-coding genes from non-additive
   components of genetic variance. Thus, the plumage colour diversity of
   the Common Buzzard could be a direct result of diminished single-locus
   genetic variation.}},

Abstract = {{The ranges of usual fluctuation of several parameters on microbial
   biomass, population and environmental conditions in low input and
   conventional rice paddy soils were monitored for two years in order to
   establish criteria to assess the abnormality of short-term effect of
   pesticide on soil microorganisms. The fluctuation patterns of the
   parameter in both paddies were generally similar. Any obvious change
   that would be considered to be due to the pesticides and chemical
   fertilizers applied in the conventional paddy was not recognized. It is
   considered that the fluctuation in the conventional paddy also had not
   been caused by the chemicals but by the agricultural practices common to
   low input paddy such as flooding and draining. The fluctuation range and
   pattern of the parameters in the paddies H ere mostly in agreement with
   the previous observation. Therefore, it is considered that the
   fluctuation of the microbial biomass and population in the soils was
   typical enough in Japanese paddies to be used as the criterion to assess
   pesticide effects. The usual fluctuation rate of the parameters ranged
   from 0.86 to 1.21 times/week for the biomass and from 0.80 to 1.40
   times/week for the population. The fluctuation rates are proposed as the
   criteria to assess the abnormality of short-term effect by pesticide.}},

Abstract = {{Bone marrow is extremely sensitive to toxicants, and in vitro culture of
   bone-marrow progenitor cells has been shown to be a sensitive indicator
   of bone-marrow injury in laboratory rodents. The ability of a
   bone-marrow progenitor cell assay to detect myelotoxicity in a wild
   rodent model ( cotton rat, Sigmodon hispidus) that inhabits many
   contaminated ecosystems in the southern United States was examined.
   Responsiveness of progenitor cells to recombinant murine
   granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF) and cotton
   rat lung-conditioned medium (LCM) was determined to optimize culture
   conditions for cotton rats. Myelotoxicity was induced in cotton rats by
   treating animals with either cyclophosphamide (8 or 80 mg/kg) or
   dexamethasone (500 mug/kg) over a 5-d period. Administration of a high
   dose of cyclophosphamide caused nearly total suppression of colony
   formation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells ( CFU-GM). Marked
   histological changes in both the bone marrow and spleen were also
   observed in cotton rats treated with a high dose of cyclophosphamide.
   Although histological lesions were not apparent, the number of CFU-GM in
   the bone marrow of low-dose cyclophosphamide- and dexamethasone-treated
   cotton rats was significantly suppressed compared to controls. The
   number of CFU-GM was consistently higher using LCM than recombinant
   murine GM-CSF. This reproducible, quantitative, in vitro bone-marrow
   progenitor cell culture system was a sensitive indicator of
   myelotoxicity in wild cotton rats and should be useful for monitoring
   chronic exposures to low levels of environmental toxicants in wild
   rodent populations.}},

Abstract = {{Various chemical mixtures exist in soil contaminated with petrochemical
   wastes, yet no comprehensive assessment of their impact on terrestrial
   ecosystems has been conducted. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   hematotoxicity risks to wild populations of cotton rats ( Sigmodon
   hispidus) residing in habitats previously contaminated by petroleum
   industrial wastes. Resident cotton rats were monitored on nine
   contaminated sites and nine ecologically matched reference sites in
   Oklahoma. The possible toxicological interactions of petrochemical
   wastes on bone marrow was investigated by using the assay of colony
   formation of granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. There was a
   consistent significant 21 to 39\% decrease in the number of
   colony-forming units of granulocyte-macrophage ( CFU-GM) in cotton rats
   from petrochemical-contaminated sites compared to matched reference
   sites, with no marked changes in hematological or histopathological
   parameters. These results suggest that bone-marrow progenitor cell
   culture is a sensitive indicator for the assessment of ecotoxicity risks
   associated with petrochemical wastes that are generated by the oil
   refining industry. Long-term exposure to hazardous wastes associated
   with the petroleum industry may represent a subtle risk to the
   hematopoietic system in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation benefits of eradicating invasive species are clear, but
   these efforts can affect nontarget species of special concern. We
   monitored the survival of little spotted kiwi (Apteryx owenii) during a
   program that eradicated Pacific rats (Rattus exulans) and Norway rats
   (R. norvegicus) from 1965-ha Kapiti Island, New Zealand. About 90\% of
   the world population of this threatened bird was at risk during the
   poison operation. Two of 10 radiomarked kiwi died in the months
   following the aerial distribution of cereal baits containing 0.002\%
   active ingredient brodifacoum. Of 50 adult birds banded before the toxin
   application, we found 46 still alive >6 months after the toxin
   application. At worst, 8\% (3-19\%) of little spotted kiwi were killed
   by accidental poisoning. Once natural mortality was taken into account,
   the actual toxin-induced mortality was much lower than this. The
   population of little spotted kiwi on Kapiti Island did not appear to be
   affected by brodifacoum long-term, because accidental losses were
   compensated by high productivity in the breeding seasons following rat
   eradication.}},

Abstract = {{We compared habitat use, forage characteristics, and group size among
   preparturient, parturient, and nonparturient female caribou (Rangifer
   tarandus) during and after the birthing season to test hypotheses
   involving acquisition of forage and risk of predation. We monitored 39
   radiocollared females from the Mentasta caribou herd, Alaska, in 1994
   and 40 animals in 1995. Group size of females giving birth at higher
   elevations was smaller (P < 0.01) than females without young that
   occurred at lower elevations at peak parturition; that difference did
   not persist into post parturition (P > 0.5). During peak parturition,
   females with young used sites with fewer predators (P < 0.05), a lower
   abundance of forage (P < 0.05), but with variable forage quality
   compared with those sites used by females without young. We hypothesized
   that parturient females used birth sites that lowered risk of predation,
   and traded-off forage abundance for increased safety. Nonetheless, few
   differences existed between parturient and nonparturient females in
   composition of diet or in indices of diet quality; we could not
   demonstrate a nutritional cost to maternal females from our analyses. We
   suggest that increasing population density might intensify intraspecific
   competition among females for birth sites, and thereby increase
   nutritional costs of using high-elevation areas with less forage but
   fewer predators.}},

Abstract = {{Five species of pinnipeds occur in the Russian Arctic, among which only
   two species, the grey seal, Halichoerus grypus, and the harbour seal,
   Phoca vitulina, breed in Murman waters, i.e. along the northern coast of
   the Kola peninsula, Russia (Fig. 1). At the beginning of the century,
   very few harbour seals were observed in the Murman region (Smirnov
   1903). More recently, Kondakov (1992) and Zyryanov (1995, 1997)
   described a harbour seal colony in Ivanovskaya Bay (East Murman) and in
   several other bays and estuaries, where haul-out sites are used by
   smaller groups of harbour seals (Fig. 1). This Murman population appears
   to be the only significant concentration of harbour seals in the
   European part of Russia. Nonetheless, to date, very little is known
   about the Ivanovskaya Bay colony and thus further investigation is
   needed on the ecology, population size and reproductive status of this
   species along the Murman coast. The species is commonly monitored in
   adjacent areas of Scandinavia and Spitsbergen (Prestrud and Gjertz 1990;
   Bjorge 1991; Henriksen and Haug 1994). In this paper, we present
   preliminary results of investigations on the annual pup production of
   harbour seals at the main breeding site, the distribution of seals
   observed outside the breeding season and the daily activity cycle of
   seals during the summer.}},

Abstract = {{The population of monk seals Monachus monachus on the Desertas Islands
   started to decline dramatically after the 1970s, hence the introduction
   of a project for the conservation of the species in 1988. Since then
   measures have been taken to achieve effective protection of those
   islands, and environmental education, monitoring and research programmes
   have been carried out. Methodologies used have been as non-intrusive as
   possible. Ten years later, the results have proved to be very positive.
   The monk seal, as well as its habitat, are adequately protected and the
   population, estimated at 20 individuals, is now on the increase with the
   growing number of births. With regard to the finding of biological and
   ecological data on the species, although somehow limited, it has been
   sufficient to help establish the most suitable strategies for the
   protection and conservation of the monk seal on the Desertas Islands.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred and eighty eight live grey seal pups from the coasts of
   Cornwall, Devon, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly were presented for
   rehabilitation to the National Seal Sanctuary, Gweek, Cornwall, between
   August 1992 and February 1998. Significantly more male than female pups
   were seen (p<0.05). Approximately one quarter of the pups presented were
   definitely pre-weaned, and the time of year these were presented
   paralleled the protracted breeding season of the grey seat in southwest
   England. Sixty nine percent of pups were presented between October and
   December, and rough seas during these months were a probable
   contributory factor. Over half the pre-weaned pups were found within 2
   miles of known breeding sites, but the distribution pattern of weaned
   pups was likely to have been complicated by dispersal of locally born
   pups and influx of pups from other populations. One hundred and fifty
   two grey seal pups were returned to the wild during the 6-year study
   period, with trauma being the most common cause of mortality in those
   that did not survive. It is difficult to draw any specific conclusions
   about the impact of the rehabilitation programme on the fragmented grey
   seal populations of the region without improved post release monitoring.
   Suggestions for such improvements are outlined.}},

Abstract = {{Tuna longline effort declined from 23-26 million hooks per year in
   1979-82 to 2-4 million hooks per year in 1995-98. Scientific observer
   coverage averaged 7.5\% since 1988-89, but increased in 1992-93 ( mean
   23\%). Observed catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the numbers of hooks
   set were used to estimate shark catches. Between 1988-89 and 1997-98,
   about 450 000 blue sharks (Prionace glauca), 65 000 porbeagles (Lamna
   nasus) and 25 000 shortfin makos (Isurus oxyrinchus) were caught. In
   1997-98, about 45 000 blue sharks, 4000 porbeagles and 3000 makos were
   caught. Corresponding weight estimates were 1400 t, 150 t and 200 t.
   CPUE varied between foreign and domestic vessels, between north and
   south regions and among years, but there were no consistent temporal
   trends. Most males and females were immature, and most sharks were alive
   when recovered. Most sharks were processed, but usually only the fins
   were retained. The New Zealand tuna longline fishery is probably not
   seriously affecting pelagic shark stocks, but adequate assessment is not
   currently feasible. Accurate monitoring of Pacific Ocean catches is an
   important first step towards ensuring sustainability of their
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{Water quality was monitored on a spatial and temporal basis in the
   subtropical Richmond River catchment over two years. Nutrient
   concentrations varied seasonally in a complex manner with highest
   concentrations ( maximum = 3110 mug N L-1 and 572 mug P L-1) associated
   with floods. However, median (444 mug N L-1 and 55 mug P L-1)
   concentrations were relatively low compared with other parts of the
   world. The forms of nitrogen and phosphorus in streams varied
   seasonally, with greater proportions of inorganic nitrogen and
   phosphorus during the wet season. Minimum nutrient concentrations were
   found 2-3 months after flood discharge. With the onset of the dry
   season, concentration increases were attributed to point sources and low
   river discharge. There were statistically significant relationships
   between geology and water quality and nutrient concentrations increased
   downstream and were significantly related to population density and
   dairy farming. In spite of varying geology and naturally higher
   phosphorus in soils and rocks in parts of the catchment, anthropogenic
   impacts had the greatest effects on water quality in the Richmond River
   catchment. Rainfall quality also also appeared to be related both
   spatially and seasonally to human activity. Although the responses of
   the subtropical Richmond River catchment to changes in land use are
   similar to those of temperate systems of North America and Europe, the
   seasonal patterns appear to be more complex and perhaps typical of
   subtropical catchments dominated by agricultural land use.}},

   four successive years. Following trout eradication, G. olidus
   recolonized the trout-free stream section above the barrier but was
   never detected below the barrier where trout still occurred. Initial
   colonization was by juvenile G. olidus but a successful breeding
   population had established three years after trout eradication. The
   implications of the use of barriers and targeted eradication programmes
   are discussed for the management of small, threatened fish species.}},

Abstract = {{Six experimental artificial reefs for lobsters were established in
   Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, in February 1997. These have been
   monitored according to a before-after-control-impact design since
   placement by means of visual surveys, traps, tag-recapture,
   photoquadrats, and airlift sampling. Juvenile and adult lobster density
   at the reef increased from near zero to >1 lobster m(-2), significantly
   higher than the two control areas. Settlement of young-of-year lobsters
   has significantly increased. We used microwire tags to mark
   hatchery-reared lobsters and released over 2000 marked 5th-6th-stage
   lobsters in each of two years. The density of young-of-year lobsters on
   enhanced reefs was not different from that on the control reefs. Despite
   intensive sampling, we have recovered only one of the hatchery-reared
   animals. Field observations indicate possible behaviour differences in
   the hatchery-reared lobsters that might make them more susceptible to
   predation.}},

Abstract = {{The Venezuelan lobster-management plan is based on information collected
   from the Panulirus argus fishery in Los Roques Archipelago National
   Park. Panulirus guttatus are harvested illegally, as this species does
   not reach the minimum landing size (120 mm carapace length; CL). Fishers
   consider enforcement of a 120 mm minimum CL unjust and request a new
   regulation. The purpose of this study was to determine the basic
   population characteristics of P. guttatus at the Morrocoy National Park,
   to provide information for managers, and to establish a population
   monitoring program. Interviews with fishers were conducted from
   September to December 1999, and their catch was counted, measured, and
   sexed. Of the 163 lobsters surveyed, 93.3\% were P. guttatus, 6.1\% P.
   argus, and 0.6\% P. laevicauda. The size range for P. guttatus was 42.1
   to 75.6 mm CL ( average: 60.9 +/- 6.9 mm CL). Sex ratio favoured males
   (1.45:1), and 48.4\% of the 62 females examined bore eggs. The smallest
   reproductive female measured 42.1 mm CL; the largest measured 67.7 mm
   CL. Fishing is carried out in shallow waters of the outer reefs;
   lobsters are harvested by hand during nocturnal skin diving.}},

Abstract = {{The region of Madang, Papua New Guinea, has the highest reported species
   diversity of both anemonefishes (nine species) and their host anemones
   (ten species). To determine which factors may allow so many anemonefish
   species to coexist at this location, we studied their patterns of
   distribution, abundance, and recruitment. Population surveys at three
   replicate reef sites within four zones situated at varying distances
   from the mainland (nearshore, mid-lagoon, outer barrier, and offshore)
   indicated that each species of host anemone and anemonefish lived within
   a particular range of zones. Each species of anemonefish lived primarily
   with one species of host. Anemonefish species that lived with the same
   host species usually had different distribution patterns among zones
   (e.g., Amphiprion percula occupied Heteractis magnifica in nearshore
   zones, while A. perideraion occupied H. magnifica in offshore zones).
   Monitoring of natural populations showed that there were few changes
   (losses or recruitment) in the number or species of fishes associated
   with each individual anemone over periods ranging from 3 to 9 months.
   Recruitment was monitored on anemones with and without residents
   (resident fishes were removed) within each of three zones (nearshore,
   mid-lagoon, enter barrier). Significantly more anemonefishes recruited
   to anemones without resident fishes than to anemones with resident
   fishes. Each anemonefish species recruited to particular host species
   and zones. The distribution and abundance of the recruits of each fish
   species amongzones were positively correlated with the distribution and
   abundance of resident fishes in the benthic habitat. This suggests that
   the spatial patterns of recruitment among zones strongly determined the
   distribution and abundance patterns of the benthic populations, and they
   were not the result of post-recruitment mortality or movement.
   Coexistence of the nine anemonefish species on the limited anemone
   resource was considered possible because of niche differentiation (i.e.,
   differences in host and habitat utilization among zones), and the
   ability of two small species (i.e., Amphiprion sandaracinos and A.
   leucokranos) to cohabit individual anemones with other anemonefish
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality, rates of water loss, aerobic and anaerobic metabolic rates
   and changes in the parameters of cellular energy status were monitored
   in the intertidal gastropod Littorina saxatilis from different latitudes
   and shore levels during prolonged air exposure at elevated temperatures
   (30 C). Prolonged air exposure, imitating environmental conditions
   during summer low tide at high-shore levels, resulted in the onset of
   anaerobic metabolism, as indicated by the significant accumulation of
   succinate and alanine and a considerable depletion of high-energy
   phosphates (ATP and phospho-L-arginine, PLA), However, anaerobic
   metabolism accounted for only 1 to 2\% of total ATP turnover in all
   groups, the remainder being supplied by aerobic metabolism. Snails from
   the White Sea population, which were more resistant to prolonged air
   exposure at 30 C than North Sea specimens, demonstrated higher anaerobic
   capacity and a depression of overall metabolic rate by ca 20\% in air,
   whereas the less-resistant North Sea animals displayed very low
   anaerobic metabolic rates and elevated aerial oxygen consumption rates
   (110 to 125\% of the rate observed in water). Within the White Sea
   population, high-shore periwinkles demonstrated higher resistance to
   prolonged air exposure than low-shore specimens associated with lower
   evaporation water loss, reduced rates of anaerobic ATP turnover, higher
   stores of L-aspartate and lower defended values of ATP and PLA. In
   contrast, no differences were found between high- and low-shore snails
   in the North Sea. This may reflect environmental conditions at the 2
   study sites, with stronger contrasts between high- and low-shore
   habitats in the White Sea than in the North Sea. In general, our data
   show that adaptation to prolonged air exposure at elevated temperatures,
   which may occur at high-shore levels during summer low tide, does not
   necessarily involve increased anaerobic capacity in L. saxatilis.
   Instead, enhanced abilities for water conservation and metabolic rate
   depression combined with increased stores of fermentable substrate seem
   to be crucial for survival during prolonged periods of emersion.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of cod Gadus morhua population structure in European
   continental waters using molecular genetic markers have indicated high
   dispersal and limited structuring, in contrast to many tagging studies.
   More sensitive genetic techniques, in the form of microsatellite
   analysis, were used to reanalyse the population structure through the
   specific targeting of mature fish on spawning grounds. Significantly
   greater levels of differentiation were found than in previous studies,
   supporting the presence of 4 genetically distinct populations within the
   North Sea: Bergen Bank, Moray Firth, Flamborough Head and Southern
   Bight. Gene flow between the southern North Sea and eastern English
   Channel is largely restricted to populations within the Southern Bight
   (southern North Sea) and Beachy Head (eastern English Channel). The
   spawning stock in the central English Channel (Start Point) remains
   distinct from those in the Celtic Sea, Outer Hebrides, and central and
   northern North Sea. No evidence of sub-structuring within the Irish and
   Celtic Seas was found, in contrast to previous genetic studies, although
   the populations remained divergent from that of the Outer Hebrides. All
   European populations were significantly divergent from Canadian Scotian
   Shelf and Barents Sea (Bear Island) populations. The study indicates
   that the current fishery monitoring systems may need to be reassessed,
   particularly with respect to the North Sea, and highlights the value of
   using microsatellites combined with the targeting of spawning stocks to
   investigate subtle population structuring.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were performed on the amphipods Monoporeia
   affinis and Pontoporeia femorata in order to test the hypotheses that
   specific reproductive variables are affected by moderate hypoxia and/or
   slightly increased temperature. These reproductive variables include
   unfertilised/undeveloped eggs, dead eggs and females carrying a dead
   brood. In a series of experiments, amphipods were exposed to increased
   temperature during different parts of the reproduction cycle. Exposure
   prior to mating caused an increased number of dead eggs and a higher
   percentage of females carrying dead broods. Furthermore, the effects of
   low oxygen concentrations (2 to 6 Mg O-2 l(-1)), solely and in
   combination with contaminated sediments, heavy metals and hydrophobic
   organic contaminants (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and
   polychlorinated biphenyls), were tested during the reproduction cycle.
   Exposure to low oxygen concentrations induced a higher frequency of
   females carrying dead broods, and females exposed to hypoxia or
   contaminants had a lower fertility rate compared to controls Our results
   show that oxygen concentrations and temperature conditions normally
   occurring in the Baltic Sea and that are not otherwise detrimental to
   adults could severely affect the gonads and the embryos. Females with
   dead broods, undeveloped/unfertilised eggs and dead eggs are proposed as
   tools for use in monitoring non-contaminant stressors.}},

Abstract = {{Settlement and recruitment of the sea urchin Evechinus chloroticus was
   determined by a series of field and laboratory experiments on the South
   Island of New Zealand. Using settlement samplers, we monitored
   settlement of larvae at 1 to 2 mo intervals during 1992, 1993 and 1994.
   Recruitment over the same period was monitored from 3 to 8 mo intervals
   by quantifying both the density and percentage in the population of
   recruits (juveniles < 20 mm test diameter). Settlement and recruitment
   were higher in Doubtful Sound (SE South Island) than in Tory Channel (NE
   South Island). For Doubtful Sound, a large settlement between August
   1992 and February 1993 (up to 1.14 settlers sampler(-1) d(-1)) was
   followed by an increase in recruit density from 2.1 to 13.8 recruits 20
   m(-2) during the subsequent 9 mo (November 1992 to August 1993).
   Settlement during the following 2 yr was lower (<0.12 sampler(-1)
   d(-1)), during which time the density of recruits decreased from 13.18
   to 2.1 recruits 20 m(-2). A similar pattern was found in Tory Channel
   where a lower settlement intensity was observed in 1992 (<0.05
   sampler(-1) d(-1)) and the density of recruits over the following year
   was less than 0.6 individuals 20 m(-2), In 1993, settlement was up
   10-fold to 0.54 recruits sampler(-1) d(-1), and the density of recruits
   increased from 0.3 to 5.0 juveniles 20 m(-2) during the following 5 mo,
   The correlation between settlement and recruitment is described by the
   linear relationship, y = 1.4 + 0.14x(,) where y = annual recruitment
   (individuals < 20 mm TD 20 m(-2)) and x = annual settlement (total
   number of settlers on samplers). Settlement and metamorphosis behavior
   of competent larvae was examined in the laboratory, Larvae show a
   preference for natural substrates (i.e. Coralline algae > oyster shell >
   aged rock > aged plastic) and for surfaces with older biofilms. Given
   the findings of the current research, settlement samplers may be one
   tool that can increase our understanding of relative settlement
   intensity and other recruitment processes in E. chloroticus, and aid in
   the sustainable management of this species.}},

Pages = {{57-66}},
Abstract = {{The implications of cyst resuspension on germination and subsequent
   seeding of the 2 spring-bloom dinoflagellates Scrippsiella hangoei
   (Schiller) Larsen and Peridiniella catenata (Levender) Balech from the
   Baltic Sea were investigated in a field study and laboratory
   experiments. Sedimentation of resuspended cysts was monitored by an
   automated sediment trap in 2 consecutive winters prior to and throughout
   the germination period off the SW coast of Finland. The effects of
   increased irradiances and water motion on germination and germling
   survival were tested by incubating cysts at different light levels and
   in turbulent water, Cyst fluxes of both species were low during the calm
   and cold winter of 1998/1999. In 1999/2000, heavy storms caused strong
   resuspension of S. hangoei cysts, Light significantly increased the
   germination frequency of S. hangoei cysts and supported germling
   survival and cell division. In P. catenata, the percentage of excystment
   was not significantly influenced by light and germination was
   successfully completed in both darkness and light. Subsequent growth of
   the species, however, required light, although maximum cell numbers were
   encountered at an irradiance as low as 10 mu mol m(-2) s(-1).
   Small-scale turbulence reduced the germination frequency of S. hangoei
   but did not affect excystment in P. catenata. No negative effects on
   subsequent growth were detected. The favourable effects of light on
   germination and germling survival of S. hangoei emphasize that
   resuspension would be advantageous for the bloom initiation of this
   species. Cyst resuspension seems to be less important in P. catenata
   population dynamics, since germination can be successfully completed in
   darkness and the amount of cysts transported to the water surface is
   insignificant even with strong turbulent mixing. It is concluded that
   cyst resuspension may be advantageous for dinoflagellate bloom
   initiation, depending on its extent and timing and the specific
   germination requirements of the respective organism.}},

Abstract = {{The movements of 10 female and 8 male adult Dungeness crabs, Cancer
   magister (Dana, 1852), were monitored biweekly to monthly with
   ultrasonic biotelemetry for periods ranging from 73 to 555 d. Female and
   male crabs had different seasonal patterns of habitat use, depth
   distribution, and activity. The general pattern for female crabs was:
   (1) a relatively inactive period between November and mid-April at
   depths below 20 m; ovigerous crabs were typically buried during this
   period in a dense aggregation; (2) abrupt movement into shallow water
   (<8 m) in late April and residence there until early June; this movement
   was coincident with the spring phytoplankton bloom and initiation of
   larval hatching; (3) increased activity beginning in July with movement
   back to deeper water, presumably to forage. Females that molted prior to
   oviposition did so in June and July. Male crabs occupied deep water (>
   40 m) from November to April, then concentrated in shallow water (< 25
   m), segregated from females, until late July. Males were most active in
   late summer and moved into deeper water (> 30 m) near the mouth of the
   cove in fall. The range of depths were -0.5 to -61.3 m for females and
   +0.1 to -89.0 m for males. Female crabs showed fidelity to the head of
   the cove and typically ranged only 1.5 km from there. Male crabs,
   however, moved. up to 7.2 km from the head of the cove, but did not move
   close to the nearest established population of Dungeness crabs 9.6 km
   distant. The discrete population of adult Dungeness crabs in Fritz Cove
   may be representative of most Dungeness crab populations inhabiting
   shallow embayments of the coastal fjord system of southeastern Alaska.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{177-200}},
Abstract = {{The feeding behaviour of northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) was
   studied in populations from the Clyde Sea and the Kattegat during summer
   and winter. The food spectrum in the stomachs was analysed using
   traditional taxonomic methods and biochemical techniques. The vertical
   migration behaviour of krill was monitored through a 30 h series of net
   samples, whilst the trophic environment was characterised through
   accompanying quantitative analyses on the depth distribution and biomass
   of copepods and phytoplankton. Krill was found to be more carnivorous in
   the Kattegat than in the Clyde Sea, which correlated with the higher
   ratio of copepod to phytoplankton biomass found in the Kattegat compared
   with the Clyde Sea. High levels of fatty alcohols and other lipid
   markers in the stomach contents of Kattegat krill were also indicative
   of a carnivorous diet. Other food sources included detritus, terrestrial
   material and other euphausiids, underlining the opportunistic nature of
   northern krill in its choice of prey items. Analyses of stomach and
   intestinal fullness over a diel cycle showed significant variations with
   time in the Clyde Sea but not in the Kattegat. However, a diel cycle in
   the rate of ingestion was evident at both locations when comparing the
   copepod mandibles in the stomachs to the distribution of copepods in the
   environment. The fact that deep-living Calanus was not a major prey item
   suggested that there was little feeding activity during the daytime,
   when the krill occupied the deeper layers. Instead. the majority of
   mandibles were from species that were dominant in the upper layers, e.g,
   the genera Temora and Pseudocalanus. The fact that kriIl caught in the
   daytime contained the same relative composition of mandibles in the
   stomach as those caught at night is probably explained by a cessation in
   daytime feeding activity and retention of the mandibles from the night
   before. It is proposed that krill in the Clyde Sea area and the Kattegat
   show a diel rhythm in feeding activity that is believed to be an
   adaptive response to minimising predation risk.}},

Title = {{Albatross response to survey vessels: implications for studies of the
   distribution, abundance, and prey consumption of seabird populations}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2001}},

Pages = {{283-295}},
Abstract = {{The study of marine bird ecology at sea is complicated by the tendency
   of many species to follow and otherwise attend vessels.
   Vessel-attraction likely biases abundance estimates and blurs the
   correlation between seabird distributions and habitat features over
   scales of tens of kilometers. Moreover, ship-following behavior inhibits
   the statistical analysis of seabird distributions because samples too
   closely spaced in time and space are not independent. These biases have
   important implications when estimating the size of rare and endangered
   seabird populations and the prey consumption by abundant species. This
   paper illustrates how observations of seabird vessel-attendance can be
   used to mitigate the biases of vessel-attraction and ship-following
   behavior. I quantified the degree of albatross attraction to survey
   vessels off southern California, and estimated that standard 300 m strip
   transects overestimated their abundance by at least a factor of 3.57.
   Additionally, I modeled albatross ship-following behavior, and
   determined that 95\% of recognizable black-footed (Phoebastria nigripes)
   and Laysan (P. immutabilis) albatrosses ceased to follow the survey
   vessel after 60 and 38 min respectively. Using these models, I estimated
   that standard survey methods overestimated black-footed albatross
   abundance by a factor of 1.17 due to their ship-following behavior. When
   the vessel-attraction and ship-following biases were combined, standard
   survey techniques overestimated albatross squid consumption off southern
   California by a factor of 4. Determining the degree of vessel-attraction
   and the temporal scale of ship-following behavior will help design and
   analyze seabird surveys. These improvements will enhance our ability to
   monitor the distribution, abundance, and prey consumption of seabird
   populations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper surveys data obtained during 3 decades (1969-1999) of
   monitoring the macrobenthic fauna of a 50 km(2) tidal-flat area in the
   Wadden Sea (Balgzand) and compares the annual figures with similar
   long-term data series from other parts of the Wadden Sea (Groningen,
   Norderney). Despite enormous year-to-year variability in annual
   recruitment of particularly the bivalves, total-biomass values were
   remarkably stable. Detailed data are presented on the annual variability
   in recruitment success of the 4 most important bivalve species of the
   Balgzand area (Cerastoderma edule, Macoma balthica, Mya arenaria, and
   Mytilus edulis). Together these 4 species usually accounted for more
   than half of the total zoobenthic biomass and largely governed its
   year-to-year fluctuations. Recruit numbers of the 4 species observed in
   27 summers showed similar relationships with the character of the
   foregoing winter. Such relationships were also observed in other Wadden
   Sea areas in The Netherlands and Germany. These common relationships
   resulted in a certain synchrony of recruitment success between the
   species (within areas) and between areas (within species). Thus, over
   vast areas (hundreds of km), bivalve recruit densities were generally
   (though not invariably) high after severe winters and low after mild
   winters. The resulting strong year-to-year variability in recruit
   numbers (with standard errors exceeding long-term means) was only just
   passed on to subsequent total-biomass values for the following 3
   reasons: (1) the biomass of any species was generally composed of more
   than 1 year class, (2) the various species did not reach their maximal
   biomass at the same age (time elapsed after recruitment), and (3)
   feedback mechanisms (enhanced reduction of numbers at high abundance)
   were effective in some species.}},

Title = {{Colony size-frequency distributions of scleractinian coral populations:
   spatial and interspecific variation}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{43-54}},
Abstract = {{Colony size is an important characteristic for clonal modular organisms
   such as corals because life-history processes, e.g. reproduction and
   mortality, are strongly related to size. These processes are affected by
   the environment, and size-frequency distributions of coral populations
   provide information on the responses of populations to environmental
   conditions. We hypothesised that the size-frequency structure of coral
   populations in degraded environments would differ from those in a more
   pristine environment. We used log-transformed colony-size data of 13
   coral species from the fringing reefs of Curacao, Netherlands Antilles.
   Data were collected at 4 sites. representing 2 environments: a heavily
   urbanised coastal area with degraded reefs, and an upstream control
   area. Population structure was dependent on species and site.
   Size-frequency distributions of the same species from different sites
   were twice as similar as distributions of different species, indicating
   the strong effects of various life-history traits among species. Site
   effects were indicated by significant differences between distributions
   of Ii species at 4 sites. Mean colony size Varied up to an order of
   magnitude between species, and much less between sites; however, in 10
   species mean colony size was also significantly different among the 4
   sites. The pattern of the differences was not consistent among species,
   indicating that mean colony size in degraded sites was higher for some
   species and lower for others. Parameters describing the shape of the
   population appeared to reflect a general response to reef condition. In
   the degraded area, frequency distributions tended to show increased
   negative skewness, occasionally extreme positive kurtosis, and smaller
   standard deviations: II populations were generally more negatively
   skewed, with the bulk of the population concentrated in the larger size
   classes; kurtosis was on average higher and extremely peaked; and
   standard deviations indicated that colony size varied less. This
   evidence suggests lower recruitment and higher partial mortality in
   larger colonies in this area. Lower recruitment decreased the influx
   into the smaller size classes of the populations. and higher partial
   colony-mortality decreased the proportion of colonies in the higher size
   classes while simultaneously increasing the proportion of colonies in
   the medium-sized classes. Species that attained large sizes (indicative
   of great age) appeared to have size-frequency distributions skewed to
   the left, while small species were more skewed to the right. The data
   indicate a general dichotomy in coral life-history strategies with
   respect to colony size. with small species generally having a shorter
   lifespan and reproduction being relatively frequent and successful.
   Thus, new input into smaller size classes occurs continuously. Species
   that attain large sizes live longer and are less dependent on frequent
   recruitment, and consequently populations tend to become `impoverished'
   in small colonies, resulting in size-frequency distributions that are
   skewed to the left. Based on changes in population structure, this
   research indicates that some species, such as Colpophyllia natans and
   Diploria labyrinthiformis, are relatively sensitive to environmental
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The number of eggs produced in the annual spawning season by an adult
   female Macoma balthica (L.) of Wadden Sea origin increases in a
   non-linear manner with increasing shell length and body weight. It
   depends primarily on the weight-at-length immediately before spawning.
   Lean individuals with a low body-mass index (BMI) of 5.6 mg cm(-3) or
   less spawn no eggs. Gamete output increases to about one-third of
   soft-body weight tin the order of 100 000 eggs) at the maximal BMIs
   observed (similar to 15 mg cm(-3)). Long-term monitoring (> 20 yr) of
   densities of a Wadden Sea M. balthica population revealed that survival
   to the spawning season of the next year declined from about 65\% at
   higher-than-average values of BMI (>8 mg cm(-3)) to about 30\% at the
   lowest values of BMI observed (5 to 6 mg cm(-3)). Annual growth was also
   significantly lower in years starting with a low BMI value. Because
   spawning lowers body weight and thus the BMI, spawning is bound to
   reduce subsequent survival rates and body-weight increments. Thus, a
   trade-off situation exists between immediate and future spawning
   outputs. The consequences for total lifetime egg production of various
   levels of gamete output at first spawning (at an age of 2 yr) were
   estimated by model calculations, starting from a wide range of body
   weights at a standard length. The model results realistically predict
   that maximal Lifetime egg production can be achieved only if M, balthica
   refrain from spawning at BMIs below a certain threshold value (viz.
   similar to6 mg cm(-3), which is close to their actual threshold of 5.6
   mg cm(-3)) and if their spawning output increases with weight-at-length
   (again in a manner close to what actually happens). It is concluded that
   M. balthica populations in the Wadden Sea apply a spawning strategy
   adapted to the local conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Analyses of population trends and movements of harbor seals in Prince
   William Sound (PWS) casts doubt on published findings that 302 seals
   were killed by the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989. Assumptions that
   seals have 100\% fidelity to a haul-out, that they were not displaced by
   the spill and associated disturbances, and that population trends
   throughout PWS varied similarly, except for oil spill effects, are not
   supported. Survey efforts to account for missing seals in 1989 were
   incomplete, too late in the year, and geographically limited. Basic
   assumptions required for statistical comparisons of oiled and unoiled
   haul-outs were violated. Fourteen dead seals, mostly pups, were
   recovered in PWS. Cause of death in most instances could not be
   determined, nor could the proportion that would have died naturally.
   Evidence does not support high unsubstantiated mortality, but is more
   consistent with seals avoiding or moving away from some oiled haul-outs.
   Interpretation of survey results requires consideration of temporal and
   regional variation. ``Route A{''} surveys of central and eastern PWS do
   not represent population trends in western PWS or at glacial haul-outs.
   To adequately monitor population trends of PWS as a whole, broader
   sampling must be conducted on a routine basis.}},

   two sites in the Lagoon of Venice was carried out together with a
   transplantation experiment. The sites were chosen for their different
   hydrological conditions and pollution levels. Several physiological and
   histochemical stress-related parameters have been measured. Clearance
   rate and scope for growth are significantly affected by higher
   anthropogenic contamination levels acting on natural clam beds, though
   they are not responsive in transplanted animals after a six-week
   exposure. On the contrary ``survival in air{''} response and lysosomal
   latency time are confirmed as early warning indices, particularly
   suitable for both monitoring approaches. Clam T. philippinarum is
   proposed as an indicator species in order to obtain an integrated

Abstract = {{The effect induced by vagile macrofauna on the growth of the Rhodophyta
   Gracilaria verrucosa (Huds.) was evaluated in the Lesina Lagoon
   (southern Italy) through an in situ manipulation experiment. Percent wet
   weight daily growth rates and percent ash content of pre-weighted G.
   verrucosa thalli were monitored for 28 days in enclosures made of nets
   with fine (220 pm, ``F{''} treatment) and medium mesh (2000
   mum,{''}M{''} treatment). Both partial and total faunal exclusion
   treatments showed a significant negative variation of daily growth rates
   together with evident fouling phenomena confirmed by the percent total
   ash content analysis on Gracilaria samples. A further analysis on ash
   content of thalli fragments free from fouling organisms excluded any
   effective variation of macroalgal tissue ash content. The study
   highlighted a significant effect induced by vagile epifauna on G.
   verrucosa growth, accomplished through an indirect control on fouling
   organisms. Our results support, besides regeneration phenomena of
   nutrients necessary for growth induced by particulate detritus
   processing (widely documented in the literature),the hypothesis of a
   further, positive action of herbivorous-detritivorous macrofauna on
   macroalgal populations in salt marsh and coastal environments. The
   results, moreover, suggest a potentially effective control method on the
   quality of Gracilaria, which is extensively used as an agar source.}},

Abstract = {{From May 1997 to April 1998 we have studied the colonisation dynamics of
   88 experimental panels, monitoring the allele and genotypic frequencies
   at GPI locus and GPI activity, of Balanus amphitrite in 3 sites from the
   lagoon of Venice. Two sampling stations are characterised by severe
   chemical (the Industrial Channel) and thermal pollution (the outflow of
   the cooling system of the Fusina electric power plant). A third station
   is located in the southern part of the lagoon (Chioggia) where chemical
   pollution is relatively low and thermal pollution absent. The mean
   number of successfully colonising animals is significantly different
   among sites and 80\% of total collected individuals is from the power
   plant outflow. Very low variability at CPI locus is observed in all
   sites and on all dates; the frequency of the most common allele is
   higher than 90\%. Most animals (91\%) are homozygotes and significant
   deficiency of heterozygotes, with respect to the H-W equilibrium, is
   described in populations from the power plant outflow and from Chioggia
   after 160 and 310 days from panel immersion, respectively. The GPI
   activity is higher in homozygotes than in heterozygotes and is
   significantly different among stations. The low genetic variability at
   GPI locus cannot be linked to chemical and thermal pollution.
   Differences in enzymatic activity between genotypes and among sites
   indicate high fitness and plasticity of the homozygote organisms.}},

Title = {{Development of Ac and Ds transposon tagging lines for gene isolation in
   diploid potato}},

Abstract = {{For the development of an efficient transposon tagging strategy it is
   important to generate populations of plants containing unique
   independent transposon insertions that will mutate genes of interest. To
   develop such a transposon system in diploid potato the behavior of the
   autonomous maize transposable element Ac and the mobile Ds element was
   studied. A GBSS (Waxy) excision assay developed for Ac was used to
   monitor excision in somatic starch-forming tissue like tubers and
   pollen. Excision of Ac results in production of amylose starch that
   stains blue with iodine. The frequency and patterns of blue staining
   starch granules on tuber slices enabled the identification of
   transformants with different Ac activity. After excision the GBSS
   complementation was usually not complete, probably due to the segment of
   DNA flanking Ac that is left behind in the GBSS gene. Molecular and
   phenotypic analyses of 40 primary transformants classified into 4
   phenotypic classes revealed reproducible patterns. A very high
   percentage (32.5\%) of the primary transformants clearly showed early
   excision in the first transformed cell as displayed both by the analysis
   of the GBSS excision marker gene as well as DNA blot analyses. Genotypes
   useful for tagging strategies were used for crosses and the frequency of
   independent germinal transpositions was assessed. In crosses to Ds
   genotypes, excision of Ds was revealed that correlated to the activity
   of the Ac genotype. A line displaying Ac amplification to multiple
   copies conferred a high frequency of independent Ds transpositions. The
   genotypes described here are useful in somatic insertion mutagenesis
   aimed at the isolation of tagged mutations in diploid potato.}},

Abstract = {{The value of grass for amenity and agricultural use is increasing and
   breeding has been very successful in improving a wide range of important
   traits. Breeding methods are continuing to develop and are now
   interacting with techniques based on novel biotechnology in all stages
   of breeding. New objectives can be devised as new opportunities arise to
   create and manipulate genetic variation. DNA fingerprinting can help to
   determine genetic distance between gene pools, optimise the construction
   of new breeding populations and identify the best parents for hybrid or
   synthetic varieties. Genetic maps and QTL analysis allow the location of
   genes associated with valuable but difficult to measure traits, such as
   the quality of forage for ruminant feed or the wear properties of
   turfgrass. Once identified and tagged these genes are relatively easy to
   monitor during recurrent selection and introgression. Improvements in
   the measurement and heritability of valuable traits will increase the
   extent and rate of selection response as automated techniques for high
   throughput genotyping facilitate increases in selection intensity.
   Strategies for variety construction may also develop which exploit
   heterotic non-additive gene effects to greater effect. Traditional and
   new breeding techniques must be combined to maximise short-term gains
   without compromising longer-term benefits.}},

Abstract = {{This issue of Natural Areas Journal focuses on ecology and management of
   rare plants of the southeastern United States. This region lies mostly
   south of the Wisconsin glacial boundary and includes sections of the
   Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Appalachian Highlands Physiographic
   Provinces. Lack of glaciation might have helped concentrate rare plants
   in the Southeast; varied geology, topography, and soils contribute to
   diverse habitats with rare plants. Habitat loss threatens rare plants of
   southeastern ecosystems. Development and fire exclusion have contributed
   to fragmentation and rarity in once widespread longleaf pine communities
   and in Florida scrub. Depression wetlands, which dot the southern
   coastal plain and are foci for rare plants, are often ditched or
   drained. Urbanization has fragmented rare plant populations along river
   corridors. The articles in this issue focus on the distribution of
   southeastern rare plants and some habitats of concern, and discuss
   ecological and management aspects of rarity. As rare plant populations
   decline in the southeast, detailed information on their distributions
   and ecological interactions can inform monitoring and management
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Southeastern hardwood forests burn infrequently and are characterized by
   high habitat and microsite diversity. Rare plants of these forests are
   mostly herbs associated with specific habitats (e.g., hardwood coves,
   wetlands) or other geographic regions. Habitat prediction models for
   rare plants can be useful when large areas must be surveyed or
   populations must be established. We developed a habitat prediction model
   for four species of southeastern hardwood forests: Nestronia umbellula,
   Carex chapmanii, Rhododendron flammeum, and Habenaria lacera. The model
   suggests that the Carer has strong affinity to habitat resource and
   vegetation conditions. In contrast, Nestronia umbellula is not strongly
   associated with habitat characteristics. The model did not accurately
   predict N. umbellula habitat, possibly because it did not account for
   this plant's clonal and partially parasitic habit or its tolerance of
   periodic burning. Rhododendron flammeum is strongly associated with
   specific topographic variables, and the model fairly accurately
   predicted its habitat. Although H. lacera is strongly associated with
   habitat resources and vegetation, its habitat is small in area and was
   not well predicted by the GIS-based model. These four examples suggest
   that models based on resource and vegetation characteristics can
   accurately predict habitat, but only when plants are strongly associated
   with these variables and the scale of modeling coincides with habitat
   size. Habitat prediction models can be useful tools for managing rare
   plants of southeastern hardwood forests, especially when combined with
   information gained through research and monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring populations of endangered, threatened, or sensitive species
   to provide information on population status and trends is often
   mandated. Monitoring plant population size over time is not trivial,
   even though plants are stationary. Demographic status often must be
   included in monitoring information because individuals of different
   status contribute differentially to population dynamics. However, the
   important status may be difficult to census, and resource limitations
   may preclude complete demographic monitoring of all but the smallest and
   most important populations. Further, the duration of the census activity
   controls the power to detect a trend, so comparability with any prior
   data increases the current value of any monitoring program. The optimal
   monitoring protocol need not be a single methodology and intensity
   applied to the entire population. In some cases, multistage sampling,
   combining extensive plant counts with intensive demographic monitoring
   of subsets of individuals, can provide more powerful monitoring and
   simultaneously allow continued use of prior data. The key to this
   possibility is using reproductive values, estimated from intensively
   sampled subsets, as weights for the extensive plant counts.}},

Abstract = {{Natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in groundwater has been
   evaluated at numerous sites within the United States. Because terminal
   electron accepting processes have a significant effect on the
   biodegradation rate of various chlorinated organics, scientists have
   spent a significant amount of time collecting data related to various
   terminal electron acceptors, such as dissolved oxygen, nitrate, iron,
   sulfate and methane. However, it is not only important to understand
   which terminal electron accepting process is predominating at a site to
   establish biodegradation rates, but it is also essential to obtain an
   understanding of the total organic carbon (TOC) source and how this
   geochemical indicator is affecting biodegradation rates. This paper
   discusses how TOC concentration and type affects the degradation rates
   of trichloroethylene (TCE), cis-1,2-dichloroethylene (DCE) and vinyl
   chloride (VC) in three different plumes in the Phoenix area. One of the
   plumes was the result of chlorinated solvents leaching from a landfill
   material. The other two plumes were due to contamination from a variety
   of sources, such as leaking underground storage tanks, dry wells,
   leachfields and other surface disposal incidences. All three plumes are
   typically anaerobic. It appears that in some locations where reductive
   dechlorination has occurred, current TOC concentrations are low. This
   may be the result of the indigenous microbial population utilizing the
   available biodegradable carbon sources in the groundwater. Based on
   evaluating the data from 3 chlorinated solvents sites in the Phoenix
   area, it appears that the type and concentration of TOC is important to
   understanding and estimating biodegradation rates of chlorinated
   solvents in groundwater. Likewise, monitoring and understanding the
   geochemical parameter TOC is of primary importance in evaluating natural
   attenuation of chlorinated organics in groundwater.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to interpret microcosm experimental results
   as part of assessment of monitored natural attenuation (MNA) at a
   tetrachloroethene (PCE) contaminated site. Models were developed using
   the SEAM3D (Sequential Electron Acceptor Model, 3 Dimensional) reductive
   dechlorination package to simulate microcosm experiments. The results of
   the numerical modeling study suggested that while the aquifer provided
   the reduced environment for reductive dechlorination, different
   reductive pathways were exhibited in each microcosm. In one microcosm,
   PCE was reduced sequentially to vinyl chloride (VC) while in the other
   microcosm partial reduction of PCE to cis-1,2-dichloroethene
   (cis-1,2-DCE) occurred with limited observed trichloroethene (TCE)
   production. Slow cis-1,2-DCE degradation rates from the first microcosm
   and the limited ability to degrade cis-1,2-DCE in the latter microcosm
   may stem from sparse microbial populations capable of reducing
   cis-1,2-DCE, different affinities of the microbes to degrade higher
   chlorinated compounds over lesser chlorinated compounds, or both.}},

Abstract = {{Landfills are not sterile environments. In fact it can be argued that
   they are the ultimate reactors for biodegradation as they contain
   nutrients, bacteria, and various redox conditions which, then, change
   over time. Enhancement of the landfill environment to optimize the rates
   of biodegradation and to ensure more rapid stabilization of the waste
   mass and availability of land fill volume needs to be developed.
   Research has progressed from laboratory to pilot to full-scale landfill
   studies. As part of a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement,
   Waste Management, Inc. and the United States Environmental Protection
   Agency's Office of Research and Development are studying bioremediation
   in full scale municipal solid waste landfills operated conventionally
   and as bioreactors over time and developing methods to monitor the
   degradation to ensure optimum operation. The microbial enumeration of
   harvested wastes landfilled for approximately five years conventionally
   in Unit 5, cell 1, coring 23 in the Outer Loop Landfill in Louisville,
   KY has been studied. The results of these analyses indicate that there
   is no statistically significant correlation between moisture content (47
   to 65\%) of the wastes and depth in the landfill (r(2) = 0.027), numbers
   of total aerobic (r(2) = 0.085), total anaerobic (r(2) = 0.179), sulfate
   reducing (r(2) = 0.185) and denitrifying bacteria (r(2) = 0.048). There
   is also no statistically significant correlation between the numbers of
   sulfate reducing and denitrifying bacteria (r(2) = 0.018). After
   addition of nitrified leachate to the landfill cell, it will be
   determined if this retrofit bioreactor demonstrates increased moisture
   content and numbers of bacteria.}},

   Swiss chard grown in previously wheat-monocultured soils, suggesting
   that significant loss of H. schachtii suppressiveness occurred during
   the monoculture. Following fallow, two H. schachtii-resistant or two H.
   schachtii-susceptible cultivars, introduced sugar beet cyst nematode
   populations remained small, suggesting that suppressiveness had been
   maintained. In a field trial with H. schachtii suppressive soil, cyst
   nematode population densities remained lower under wheat, resistant
   sugar beet, resistant radish and susceptible radish than under
   susceptible sugar beet.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, the shrimp farming industry is facing serious disease problems
   and growing concerns about the potentially detrimental impact of
   effluents. Adequate feed management methods are critical for efficient
   production and to minimize environmental impact. Shrimp production
   systems (ponds, tanks, raceways) and their feed management must be
   considered together and require an understanding of biological aspects
   of the targeted species, of chemical and biological processes that
   control water and bottom quality, and continuous system monitoring and
   feedback to provide appropriate and timely inputs and adjustments.
   Effective practices wilt produce maximum shrimp growth and survival
   concurrent with the lowest feed conversion, will reduce feed input
   needed and will minimize. any impact of effluents. Inadequate feed
   management will lead to sub-optimal production, can promote the onset of
   various diseases and can lead to water quality-related problems which
   will adversely affect production. Several sequential steps are involved
   in proper feed management: feed selection; reception, storage and
   handling; application methods, and feeding regimes. When to feed
   requires determining diel activity patterns, feeding frequency and time
   (subject to change with geographical location, species, age, size,
   stocking density, season, unusual environmental conditions and other
   stimuli). Calculating feed rations involves estimating survival,
   population size and biomass, and size distribution. Evaluating and
   adjusting feed input involves regular population sampling and also
   proper monitoring of various water parameters. Shrimp are bottom feeders
   and it is difficult to estimate feed consumption rate, unless feed trays
   or lift nets are used. Trays are currently one of the best options to
   manage and adjust feed inputs and prevent under- and overfeeding.
   Inefficient management methods commonly include inadequate handling and
   storage practices for both bulk feed storage at farms and after feed
   distribution to pond side for daily feedings. Ineffective practices
   often include applying feed during times convenient for employees
   (during daylight hours) but not necessarily at the best times for
   shrimp. The development and use of compound aquafeeds has been a major
   factor in the successful expansion of shrimp farming, and feed
   management is crucial to maintain and improve industry financial and
   environmental viability. There is much potential to improve and optimize
   feed management practices that can be species-, area- and even
   season-specific, to optimize production efficiency, minimize effluents
   and promote maximum biosecurity. This review reports on a global survey
   of shrimp feed management practices, including those implemented in more
   intensive and reduced/zero exchange systems, and incorporating data from
   Australia, Belize, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua,
   Panama, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Venezuela. Finally,
   perspectives for improved feed management are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Diseases are having a devastating effect on the productivity and
   profitability of shrimp farms worldwide. The arsenal used to diagnose
   and formulate disease control programs includes microbiology,
   histopathology, virology and molecular biology. Epidemiology or
   population medicine is another weapon that can be used in this fight.
   Epidemiology is the study of disease in populations and associated risk
   factors that contribute to its level of expression. Two basic
   epidemiologic approaches can be used to predict and to understand the
   population consequences of diseases: the statistical and the dynamic or
   functional approaches. Statistical epidemiology is the application of
   statistical models to identify factors that are associated with the
   expression of disease. This is typically undertaken by analyzing the
   observed pattern of disease occurrence and the co-occurrence of disease
   with a set of conditions. Among these conditions there may be
   environmental ones such as geography, temperature, season, salinity,
   shrimp density. Statistical epidemiology studies are concerned with
   identifying these risk factors, quantifying their effect on survival and
   production, and formulating and monitoring control strategies on a farm,
   pond or country level. Although there is often a cause and effect
   relationship between the factors and the expression, that is not
   necessary to the method. The primary goal is to predict the occurrence
   of the disease. For example, the geographic location of a farm may be a
   good predictor of risk, but in fact, the relationship between geography
   and disease is the occurrence of a vector in one location but not in the
   other. Although the location predicts the occurrence, location is not
   the cause, the vector is the cause. The dynamic approach to epidemiology
   attempts to construct models of the dynamics of diseases in populations
   by incorporating causal relations among the factors. Although the
   functional approach may predict the occurrence of disease, its primary
   goal is to understand the cause and effect relationships. For example,
   shrimp density is a factor that may be useful in statistical
   epidemiology as a risk factor, but for a functional approach the goal is
   to understand the way that density influences an outbreak. One outcome
   of this approach has been the concept of threshold density. The
   threshold density is a minimum shrimp density below which there will not
   be enough transmission of the pathogen among shrimp to offset the loss
   of infected shrimp by death or by recovery. Epidemiology studies
   utilizing both the statistical and functional approaches are needed to
   identify risk factors affecting the major shrimp diseases of shrimp
   aquaculture today, to quantify their effect on survival and production,
   and to formulate monitoring and control strategies on a pond, farm or
   country level.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides the first quantitative comparison of methods for
   monitoring herbivory and growth of New Zealand beech mistletoes (Alepis
   flavida, Peraxilla colensoi and Peraxilla tetrapetala). Four monitoring
   methods-leaf maps, volume estimates visual estimates of browse and
   foliage density, and repeat fixed-point photographs-were used to assess
   the health of 60 permanently tagged mistletoe plants in four South
   Island beech forests between February 1997 and February 1998. Leaf maps
   provided the most detailed information but were extremely
   labour-intensive so could only be used to monitor a small number of
   plants. Photographs were much faster to use, and the results
   corresponded well to leaf map data, but A. flavida could not be
   photographed because it was frequently hidden by host foliage. Visual
   scoring methods and volume measurements did not correlate well with leaf
   maps, probably because leaf loss and growth were not obvious without
   images of plants from previous seasons. Thus, photographs can provide
   valuable reference points for future evaluation of plant condition.
   However, because photos require more time and money than visual scoring
   and can only be used on a subset of the population, their most practical
   use is as a supplement to visual scoring.}},

Title = {{Defoliators in eastern Oregon and Washington}},
Journal = {{NORTHWEST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Abstract = {{Defoliating insects are major disturbance agents affecting forest health
   and productivity in eastern Oregon and Washington. Information on the
   four main defoliators of conifers in eastern Oregon and Washington is
   abundant. Because of concerns about growth suppression and mortality of
   trees during widespread defoliator outbreaks, much research effort has
   been focused on these species. They are western spruce budworm
   (Choristoneura occidentalis), Douglas-fir tussock moth (Orgyia
   pseudotsugata), pandora moth (Coloradia pandora), and larch casebearer
   (Coleophora laricella). Various interactions of defoliators with other
   system components and natural regulatory processes have been described,
   as have monitoring and suppression techniques using pheromone traps.
   Large-scale suppression projects using both chemical and biological
   materials have been used in attempts to control some defoliator
   outbreaks. While such suppression projects have prevented some tree
   mortality and growth loss, they have been largely ineffective in
   changing the outbreak behavior of these insects. Some suppression
   materials have undesirable side effects on non-target insects such as
   sensitive or endangered moths, butterflies, and skippers, or on other
   ecological processes. Successful control of larch casebearer has been
   achieved by introduction of parasitic wasps. For most defoliators, the
   recommended strategy is preventative: silvicultural treatment to promote
   a diversity of tree species, stand structures, and moderate stocking
   levels. Decision-support tools UPEST and UTOOLS analyze insect and
   disease risks, and the Forest Vegetation Simulator models effects of
   insects and disease on stand growth.}},

Journal = {{NORTHWEST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{21-30}},
Abstract = {{Bark beetles are well described in terms of life history and general
   ecology for the six beetle species of concern in eastern Oregon and
   Washington: Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins;
   mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins; western pine beetle, D.
   brevicomis LeConte; spruce beetle, D. rufipennis (Kirby); fir engraver,
   Scolytus ventralis LeConte; and, pine engraver, fps pini (Say). Many
   interactions between bark beetles and other agents and resources have
   been described. Wildfire, windstorms, disease, other insects, and land
   management practices can weaken trees and attract bark beetles that
   become locally epidemic. At low population levels, beetles perform
   useful functions by creating habitat and forage for many organisms, but
   outbreaks can cause extensive tree mortality and increase risk of
   wildfire. Natural control agents such as birds, predatory beetles,
   parasitoids, and parasites, have been studied, but have not been
   employed operationally in management strategies. While
   semiochemcial-baited traps provide information about population
   fluctuations locally, large area monitoring relies primarily on aerial
   surveillance. Stand susceptibility, hazard, or risk-rating systems exist
   for most of these species, and infestation growth or damage models are
   available for a few. In most cases, pesticide sprays, attractants and
   anti-aggregants, and trap-tree techniques have been useful in specific
   applications. Anti-aggregants have been proven useful in large-scale
   operations for Douglas-fir beetle. Salvage or sanitation of infested,
   wind- or fire-damaged trees can prevent population build-ups if done
   promptly. Integration of these methods along with prescribed fire and
   tree thinning has been recommended. Decision-support tools are becoming
   more prevalent but each requires validation for different geographic
   variants..}},

Abstract = {{As the population increases, suitable land for wastewater treatment and
   dispersal decreases. Drip distribution of wastewater is becoming more
   popular as an alternative form of on-site wastewater dispersal. This
   method of dispersal distributes the wastewater in small uniform doses,
   allowing the soil system more opportunity to treat the wastewater before
   it reaches the groundwater, even on less suitable soil types. This
   protects the environment as well as human health.
   During the summer of 1999, soil samples were collected to a depth of 105
   cm (42 in.) beneath six drip distribution sites in Wisconsin to evaluate
   the treatment performance of the soil. Three of the sites received
   septic tank effluent (STE), one site received recirculating gravel
   filter (RGF) effluent and two sites received effluent treated by aerobic
   treatment units (ATU). The soils at these sites ranged from coarse sand
   to clay loam. The depth of the driplines ranged from 10-50 cm (4-20 in.)
   below the ground surface.
   The systems receiving STE showed very low fecal coliforms at 45-60 cm
   (18-24 in.) below the dripline with no detects below 60 cm (24 in.). The
   systems with pretreatment showed even better results, both for the RGF,
   which was very heavily loaded, and the ATU systems. This could probably
   allow for a reduction in the separation distance to 45 cm (18 in.) for
   systems receiving STE and 30 cm (12 in.) if the effluent is aerobically
   pretreated to a fecal coliform level of <1,000 colonies/100 ml. The
   nitrate-nitrogen levels exiting the system at 105 cm (42 in.) below the
   dripline had median values in the range of 26-83 mg N/L of soil water,
   regardless of treatment type. However, these concentrations are similar
   to the background levels, which were unexplainably high. The
   ammonium-nitrogen levels at 105 cm. (42 in.) were also similar to
   background levels.
   Temperatures were monitored at four of these sites from December 1, 1998
   - March 30, 1999 and at five of these sites from December 1, 1999 -
   March 14, 2000. Although these were two mild winters for Wisconsin, air
   temperatures did fall below 0 C (32 F) for an extended period of time at
   each of the sites. In most cases, negative temperatures (Celsius) were
   also found in the soil at the depth of the dripline, as well as 10 cm (4
   in.) below the dripline, often lasting a week at a time below 0 C (32
   F). Soil temperatures at 10 cm (4 in.) below the depth of the dripline
   reached minimums of -1 C (30 F) in the southern portion of the state to
   -12 C (10 F) in the north. However, none of the systems studied
   encountered operational problems due the cold temperatures. With proper
   design and installation, drip distribution systems are an excellent
   alternative system for wastewater dispersal in cold climates.}},

Abstract = {{While there has been significant growth in marine sediment profile
   imagery (REMOTS(R) Sediment Profile Imagery) since the 1980s, reports of
   back-to-back Sediment Profile Imagery (SPI) with more traditionally
   generated benthic data are still quite rare. In May 1987, a SPI camera
   array was deployed at coastal sites in Ireland and France aspart of a
   demonstration project funded by the European Union. At each location,
   its effectiveness was evaluated against a background of ground truth
   data provided by grab and core sampling. This paper introduces data
   obtained in Galway Bay (west coast of Ireland) from sediment profile
   images collected in 1987 and in subsequent benthic recharacterizations
   (up to 1997) of some of the same biotopes, and compares selected SPI
   returns with those provided by the more traditional methods. The
   findings corroborate the view that SPI is a powerful sampling tool that
   is at its best when used in concert with a detailed, calibrated base
   derived from quality traditional sampling and sample processing.}},

Abstract = {{Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in south-west Uganda supports a
   population of gorillas that has become the primary gorilla population
   for tourism following the genocide in Rwanda. Previous estimates made in
   the early 1990s indicated that the population numbered around 300
   individuals. The census reported here was the first in Bwindi to use the
   method successfully developed in the Virungas, which utilizes a complete
   sweep across the park within a short period of time by a large number of
   teams working simultaneously. We estimated the population to be 292
   individuals; to the best of our understanding - based on previous
   estimates - the population, therefore, appears to be stable. Most
   gorillas were found within the centre of the southern section of the
   park. It appears that there are some areas of unused habitat and,
   therefore, room for the population to grow. We found no clear
   relationship between gorilla distribution and human presence, but some
   forms of disturbance were moro frequent and close to the edge of the
   park and may contribute to the gorillas' avoidance of these areas. The
   effects of human disturbance, including tourism, on the gorillas and
   other wildlife should be investigated in more detail and monitored over
   time. This is particularly important in multiple-use zones which have
   been established around the edges of the park for bee-keeping,
   collection of non-timber forest products, and tourism.}},

Abstract = {{Hand sorting of soil blocks is a reliable but very labour intensive and
   tedious method for estimating earthworm population sizes. A
   standardised, time-limited, intensive sorting procedure was adopted for
   a long-term earthworm field population study and the error in population
   estimates resulting from the use of this procedure was quantified during
   monthly sampling over one cropping cycle of conventional wheat and
   direct-drilling wheat-clover fields. Compared to full soil sorting
   without time restriction, time-limited sorting achieved mean relative
   recoveries of 81-87 \% of earthworm numbers and 94-97 \% of earthworm
   biomass, but required only 36 \% of the actual sorting time needed for
   full sorting. The earthworms which were missed during time-limited
   sorting were mainly unpigmented juveniles, accounting for 90 \% of the
   numbers and 70 \% of the biomass, and their mean individual biomass was
   31-38 mg. It is concluded that validated time-limited soil sorting is a
   useful, time-saving and also ergonomically advantageous approach for
   long-term studies of earthworm population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Field trials were conducted in cabbage (Brassica oleracea var capitata),
   cauliflower (B oleracea var botrytis) and knol khol (B oleracea
   gongylodes) crops at two different locations in Karnataka State (India)
   to optimize the timing of insecticide applications to control the
   diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, using sex pheromone traps. Our
   results indicate that applications of cartap hydrochloride as
   insecticide during a 12-24h period after the pheromone traps had caught
   on average 8, 12 and 16 males per trap per night in cabbage, cauliflower
   and knol khol, respectively, were significantly more effective than
   regular insecticide sprays at 7, 9, 12 or 15 days after transplantation.
   This was demonstrated by estimation of the mean number of eggs and
   larvae per plant, the percentage of holes produced, as well as the
   marketable yield of the three crops at each location. A good correlation
   between the immature stages, infestation level, the estimated crop yield
   and the number of moths caught in pheromone traps was also found,
   indicating the usefulness of pheromone-based monitoring traps to predict
   population densities of the pest. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical industry.}},

Abstract = {{The Big Blue River Basin is located in southeastern Nebraska and
   northeastern Kansas and consists of surface water in the Big Blue River,
   Little Blue River, Black Vermillion River, and various tributaries
   draining 24,968 square kilometers. Approximately 75\% of the land area
   in the basin is cultivated cropland. The Big Blue River flows into
   Tuttle Creek Reservoir near Manhattan, Kansas. Releases from the lake
   are used to maintain streamflow in the Kansas River during low flow
   periods, contributing 27 percent of the mean flow rate of the Kansas
   River at its confluence with the Missouri River. Tuttle Creek Reservoir
   and the Kansas River are used as sources of public drinking water and
   meet many of the municipal drinking water supply needs of the urban
   population in Kansas from Junction City to Kansas City.
   Elevated concentrations of pesticides in the Big Blue River Basin are of
   growing concern in Kansas and Nebraska as concentrations may be
   exceeding public drinking water standards and water quality criteria for
   the protection of aquatic life. Pesticides cause significant problems
   for municipal water treatment plants in Kansas, as they are not
   appreciably removed during conventional water treatment processes unless
   activated carbon filtering is used. Pesticides have been detected during
   all months of the year with concentrations ranging up to 200 mug/L. If
   high concentration in water is associated with high flow conditions then
   large mass losses of pesticides can flow into the water supplies in this
   basin. This paper will investigate the use of a monitoring program to
   assess the non-point source of this atrazine contamination. Several
   practices have shown ability to remediate or reduce these impairments.}},

Abstract = {{A new, annotated and critical flora inventory for the three South Aegean
   Dionysades islands is presented, differentiated for each island, and
   based on 240 own vascular plant records and all available data from
   literature. The total list for the island group comprises now 277
   species of which 51 are reported for the first time. Astragalus sesameus
   was found new for the South Aegean (Cretan area), and Medicago arborea
   is new to the native flora of wider Crete. The distribution of M.
   arborea and other cliff species into phryganic habitats on the two major
   islands was not noticed by previous researchers and is, since grazing by
   domestic herbivores was given up, probably a rather recent phenomenon. A
   comparison between the first (GANDOGER, ca. 1917) and our recent records
   (in 2000) revealed few cases of taxa which are now likely to be extinct.
   They are weeds that bear witness of former local cultivation on the two
   bigger islands, The great majority of the new findings is not owing to
   recent establishment but to previous observation gaps. There is but one
   clear case of recent introduction: Oxalis pes-caprae. The question is
   raised whether conventional species census is an adequate tool for
   island monitoring. It is suggested to install and perform a more
   consistent and standardized way of island monitoring, including
   appropriate sampling on community and population level.}},

Abstract = {{Pratylenchus thornei densities were monitored in field plots of two
   winter wheat cultivars in a dry farming area of southern Spain. Samples
   were taken fortnightly during the wheat-growing season and from the
   following dry fallow. Under durum wheat cv. `Donpedro', nematode
   densities decreased thornei increased for 5 to 6 months and then were
   maintained or slightly decreased thereafter, surviving the summer dry
   fallow in an anhydrobiotic state (78.2\% and 85.3\% survival in soil and
   roots, respectively). Under durum wheat cv. `Donpedro', nematode
   densities decreased over the growing season, although densities within
   the roots increased during the first 2 months of the wheat-growing
   period, indicating that nematodes could penetrate the roots of this
   cultivar but were unable to reproduce. These observations suggest
   resistance of wheat cv. Donpedro to P. thornei.}},

Abstract = {{The potential for developing a reliable strategy for selecting
   rhizosphere competent bacteria, based on an improved understanding of
   the community diversity and population dynamics of fluorescent
   pseudomonads, was investigated. Isolates from a collection of over 690
   fluorescent pseudomonads, obtained from sugar beet and wheat plants
   grown in field soils in laboratory microcosms, were genotypically and
   phenotypically characterised. RFLP rRNA analysis (ribotyping) revealed
   that the sampled population was composed of 385 related but distinct
   ribotypes. Most ribotypes were isolated only once and represented a
   transient colonising population. However, representatives of 26
   ribotypes were detected more often, of which five were isolated from
   rhizosphere soils sampled 7 months after the first sampling. Comparative
   phenotypic analysis of isolates (motility, antibiotic resistance and
   production, adherence, fatty acid composition, substrate utilisation
   patterns) demonstrated that the ability to utilise organic acids as
   carbon sources correlated with rhizosphere competence. Single inoculum
   and competitive colonisation studies in planted microcosms confirmed
   rhizosphere competence, but also demonstrated synergistic interactions.
   The colonisation ability and population densities of transient strains
   were significantly increased when co-inoculated with rhizosphere
   competent isolates. These data demonstrate potential cross-feeding and
   combined niche exploitation, rather than direct competition, confirming
   the multi-factorial nature of rhizosphere competence in diverse
   fluorescent pseudomonad communities. They also highlight the need to
   consider the use of mixed inocula for plant growth promotion and the
   systematic selection of strains for effective biotechnological
   exploitation.}},

Abstract = {{The paper reports 15 years' monitoring of erosion rates of drift soil
   deposits, fluctuations in vegetation cover, effects of nutrient addition
   and the population dynamics of rare species from the Keen of Hamar's
   fellfield habitat. Normal successional models do not apply on the
   fellfield since closed vegetation cover is restricted to soils on
   glacial deposits that once removed cannot be reconstituted from the
   underlying ultramafic parent material. The successional processes that
   occur are so slow and on so small a scale that it is concluded that the
   fellfield plant communities are stable. Eutrophication related to
   agricultural activity led to a temporary increase in plant cover and
   loss of habitat for the rare species. The numbers of individuals of the
   rare species have fluctuated locally from year to year but during the
   time of the observations the populations were relatively stable over the
   entire site. This means that the rarities have migrated within the site
   and this has important implications for their conservation. It is
   concluded that the Keen debris has retained more of its primeval
   appearance and vegetation than perhaps any other inland lowland area in
   the British Isles.}},

   the multifactorial nature of MBD in lizards in zoo populations and

Abstract = {{The mandate for any plant genebank is to conserve and provide quality
   germplasm with relevant information for use in crop variety development
   and plant genetic studies. Even under optimal ex situ storage
   conditions, viability declines and genetic diversity is lost. Thus, the
   monitoring of viability and timely regeneration of seeds must be a
   priority activity of all genebanks.
   Two factors have a major impact on regeneration needs and capacity.
   These are storage conditions and the capacity to handle cross-pollinated
   species. Poor seed storage conditions result in the rapid loss of seed
   viability and the need for frequent regeneration. Repeated regeneration
   can result in genetic change away from the genotypic composition of the
   originally collected sample, especially if selection pressure is
   inadvertently imposed during the process. Inadequate facilities for
   handling cross-pollinated species can cause delays in or undermine the
   regeneration process so that the genetic integrity of the sample cannot
   be guaranteed. Ideally, regeneration is conducted under neutral
   selection conditions, to reduce competition thereby minimizing genetic
   change through selection. However, this is not always possible. A
   certain degree of genetic change is inevitable, especially when
   regeneration takes place under conditions markedly different from those
   at the original collection site. The danger of genetic change during
   regeneration applies more to heterogeneous populations/accessions than
   to homogenous ones. This is because the probability of losing an allele
   (particularly a low frequency allele) increases, especially with smaller
   population sizes and under more stressful growing conditions. The
   complexity and cost of maintaining the genetic integrity of accessions
   of a crop during regeneration depends on the reproductive biology of the
   species. For instance, it is more difficult and costly to maintain the
   genetic integrity of cross-pollinated species than self-pollinated
   crops.
   The complexity and expense are higher for species which are insect
   pollinated. Reasons for regeneration problems also include: lack of
   resources (staff, funding, facilities, equipment); insufficient
   knowledge on the reproductive biology for a large number of crops; lack
   of pollinator availability; choice, or management technique; lack of
   adequate isolation distance; the need to use isolation cages; and
   insufficient information on the optimum number of plants required to
   maintain genetic integrity. Solutions to some of these problems are
   suggested.}},

Abstract = {{Allegheny woodrat (neotoma magister) populations in the northern and
   western limits of the range have been greatly reduced in recent years,
   increasing the need to locate and monitor both threatened and seemingly
   stable populations. We tested the feasibility of predicting areas of
   suitable habitat for the woodrat in the Daniel Boone National Forest
   (DBNF) by using a Geographic Information System model. Several themes
   depicting woodrat habitat variables were overlaid to produce a
   comprehensive map displaying likelihood of woodrat occurrence. Logistic
   regression analysis was used to determine effect of each habitat
   variable on woodrat occurrence based on a sample of 394 known woodrat
   occurrence sites, 511 random sites, and habitat data including slope,
   landuse, site geology, forest cover, and locations of forest openings,
   clifflines, streams, and roads. The resulting habitat model correctly
   classified 97\% of the 416 independent woodrat locations at the 0.50
   probability level. This habitat model will provide an efficient,
   cost-effective method for searching out new woodrat locations,
   monitoring and analyzing previously known locations, managing DBNF to
   maintain existing habitat, and restoring previous habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Ruffed grouse densities are lower in the southern portion of its range
   than in the more northern reaches. It has been suggested that the lower
   productivity of ruffed grouse in southern latitudes may account for
   lower population densities. We examined nesting success of ruffed grouse
   Bonasa umbellus at 2 sites in West Virginia during 1998 and 1999. We
   located nests of radio-collared female grouse and determined proportion
   of females that nested, nest success (proportion of hens successful in
   hatching greater than or equal to 1 chick), clutch size, hatching
   success, and hatch dates. Proportion of hens that attempted to nest,
   nesting success, and average clutch size and hatching success was
   similar between age classes, sites, and years. Depredation was the major
   cause of nest failure, with 30\% of nests monitored over the two-year
   period being disturbed or destroyed. Nests monitored via video cameras
   revealed raccoons (Procyon lotor) and black rat snakes (Elaphe o.

   for managing nocturnal avian communities. We compared vocalization
   playback and silent methods for surveying 3 nocturnal avian species in
   Mississippi in 1997 and 1998. Playback elicited more responses from
   eastern screech-owls (Otus asio) than the silent method. Playback was
   more effective than the silent method at detecting habitat associations
   of eastern screech-owls, which were strongly associated with pine
   regeneration stands than pine saw timber stands and pine-hardwood
   stands. Playback of broadcast vocalizations more effectively detects
   abundance of some nocturnal bird species than silent methods. Increased
   detectability and accuracy are essential for monitoring and managing
   nocturnal avian communities and their habitat associations.}},

Abstract = {{As the power and utility of molecular genetic tools continues to
   increase, ecological application of molecular genetics offers more
   opportunities to understand dynamic biological processes that contribute
   to instability or risk of undesirable change in forest ecosystems.
   Molecular diagnostic techniques may distinguish virulent pathogens from
   nonpathogenic or beneficial microorganisms, while helping to assess
   overall biological diversity. Genetic studies are underway to
   characterize pathogenic and beneficial soil fungi, such as Armillaria
   spp., and to help assess root disease risk. Population genetics studies
   can help monitor genetic variation, gene flow, and potential
   evolutionary changes in microbial and tree species. Ongoing studies are
   investigating genetic structure of western white pine (Pifuus monticola)
   and whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) to help characterize past and
   future ecological impacts of white pine blister rust, an introduced
   disease caused by Cronartium ribicola. Molecular tools can also help
   assess genetic changes in C. ribicola and other pathogens, as these
   organisms will likely evolve in response to changing environmental and
   host conditions. Risk assessments at the landscape level can be achieved
   through the integration of molecular genetic information from hosts,
   pathogens, and beneficial organisms into geographic information systems
   (GIS) that are based on remote sensing and landscape modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas cover approximately 3.5\% of the total land area of the

   about the status of the forest resource in these areas or how it is
   changing. This paper details a proposal to create a national urban
   forest health monitoring program within the USDA Forest Service's Forest
   Health Monitoring Program that would establish an estimated 11,735
   permanent urban plots nationwide. These plots would be resampled on an
   annualized 5- or 7-year cycle in the East and on a 10-year cycle in the
   West. Annual reports would provide current information on urban forest
   health, structure, and functions, and associated monetary values for
   each state/region and the nation. The information gathered on urban
   forest characteristics, particularly rates of change, would provide
   essential information for managing the urban forest resource and
   improving forest health in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to compare reproductive tiller
   development in two ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) cultivars, when
   fertilized with nitrogen. Plots of the cultivars `Grasslands Ruanui' and
   `Ellett' ryegrass were sown in April 1996. Half of each plot received
   nitrogen fertilizer (30 kg N/ha) after each grazing by dairy cows from
   September 1996 to May 1997 and from October 1997 to April 1998. Ryegrass
   tiller dynamics was monitored from September 1996 to March 1998. The
   proportion of reproductive tillers in the total tiller population was
   higher, on average, over the first flowering period (October 1996 to
   January 1997) for `Ellett' (19.5\%) than for `Grasslands Ruanui'
   (13.0\%) ryegrass, and there was no response to nitrogen. Over the
   second flowering (September 1997 to January 1998), `Ellett' ryegrass
   slightly increased the proportion of reproductive tillers in response to
   nitrogen (averaging 20\%) while `Grasslands Ruanui' decreased (P<0.05)
   the number of reproductive tillers (averaging 6\%). Significant cultivar
   x nitrogen interactions occurred in December 1997 and January 1998 when
   reproductive tiller number for nitrogen treated plants averaged 24.1\%
   for `Ellett' compared with 7.8\% for `Grasslands Ruanui' ryegrass. This
   work suggests current New Zealand ryegrasses (here represented by
   `Ellett') may produce more reproductive tillers in response to spring
   applied nitrogen fertilizer than do older types. To encourage vegetative
   tillering from the bases of dying reproductive fillers and the
   likelihood of improved ryegrass persistence, applications of nitrogen
   fertilizer in early summer are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Land desertification is one of the most serious environmental and
   social-economic problems in the North China. The processes of
   desertification mainly have being controlled by the interaction of human
   activities and fragile eco-environment, that means the pattern and
   intension of landuse are major factors for development or reverse of
   desertification. Because of the increasing pressure of population, the
   rangeland in the North China has being cultivated decade by decade,
   which changed landuse from grassing to cropping in a large area and
   destroyed the natural vegetation cover. The result is to let the wind
   erosion become easier and the desertification has developed very
   quickly. According to the statistics of desertified land areas with
   different landuse purposes, the human impact on the contributing to the
   desertification in the rangeland region were as 25\% of
   over-cultivation, 28\% of over-grassing, 32\% of over gathering firewood
   and 8\% of mis-used water resources. The occurrence and development of
   desertification in the North China is accompanied by human civilization
   history, especially in recent one hundred years the development of
   desertification is quickest. Desertification processes aggravate soil
   wind erosion, deteriorate soil physical and chemical properties, reduce
   land productivity, cause great economic loss and seriously affect
   livelihood and living environment. During last 5 decades, desertified
   land has expanded continually in the North China, which total area has
   reached over 350,000 km(2) by middle 1990's. Based on the remote sensing
   monitoring, we found that the growth rate of desertified land has being
   increased decade by decade like as the annual average spread area has
   increased 1,560 km(2) of among 1950's and middle 1970's to 2,100 km(2)
   of between middle 1970's and late 1980's, to 2,460 km(2) of last decade.
   Accordingly, in-depth study of anthropogenic effects, in particular the
   effect of over-rangeland use on the desertification development has an
   important practical significance to elucidate the mechanism of
   desertification occurrence, enrich the theory of desertification study
   and formulate the policies and measures to combat desertification. But
   some successful models of combating desertification have improved that
   where the reasonable landuse has been adopted over some years, the sandy
   desertified land has reversed and can be used again for more effective
   farming or grassing. Desertification is one of the most serious
   environment and socioeconomic problems in the world today and China is
   one of the countries suffering from serious desertification, especially
   in the north China where sandy desertification is developing rapidly
   over large areas and receiving widespread attention. According to human
   activity and socioeconomic characteristics and their interactions,
   through nearly 20 years of theoretical research and practices, we give a
   conception of sandy desertification: sandy desertification is the
   process with sand drift activity as main mark occurred in arid,
   semi-arid and partial sub-humid areas resulting from human irrational
   economic activities and inharmony between natural resources and
   environment (Zhu Zhenda, Wang Tao 1993). The occurrence and development
   of sandy desertification in the north China is accompanied by human
   civilization history, especially in recent one hundred years the
   development of sandy desertification is quickest.
   Sandy desertification processes aggravate soil wind erosion, deteriorate
   soil physical and chemical properties, reduce land productivity, cause
   great economic loss and seriously affect livelihood and living
   environment of the mixed agropastoral region in the north China.
   Accordingly, in-depth study of anthropogenic effects, in particular the
   effect of land use on the sandy desertification development has an
   important practical significance to elucidate the mechanism of sandy
   desertification occurrence, enrich the theory of desertification study
   and formulate the policies and measures to combat sandy desertification.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed the presence of ribosomal
   RNA genes in paracentromeric regions of all A chromosomes and in the
   distal half of B chromosomes in embryonic cells from Moroccan specimens
   of the grasshopper Eyprepocnemis plorans. The expression of these genes
   was monitored by the presence of nucleoli attached to each chromosome
   bivalent in diplotene cells from males collected from two different
   Moroccan populations and was compared to previous data of Spanish
   populations. Whereas only the nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) on
   S-9-S-11 and X chromosomes were active in the Spanish specimens,
   Moroccan individuals showed NOR activity in all chromosomes. The rRNA
   genes on the B chromosome were inactive in both populations. The S-9 and
   S-10 NORs were less active in Moroccan specimens than in Spanish
   specimen, which might be partly explained by the negative
   interdependence for expression of the S-10 NOR with respect to those on
   L-2 and X chromosomes. On the other hand, the X NOR was more active in
   Moroccan specimens than in Spanish specimens, and this might be partly
   due to the positive effect that the presence of B chromosomes has on the
   expression of this NOR. The implications of these observations on
   current models of NOR activity regulation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular markers allow breeders to infer the genotypic value from the
   marker genotype, and to monitor the accumulation of favourable genes or
   chromosome segments (QTAs, for alleles at a QTL) in one genotype. In
   this synthesis, we consider three main applications with theoretical and
   experimental results: 1) the backcross for several QTAs, 2) different
   modalities of marker-assisted recurrent selection (mainly selection on
   markers only and combined selection on markers and phenotype), and 3)
   marker-assisted recurrent genotype building, genotype building being
   defined as the accumulation of favourable QTAs in one genotype,
   monitored by markers. Some possible consequences of the development of
   genomics are discussed. Genomics makes it possible to have direct
   markers of QTLs, without the risk of recombination between the marker
   and the QTL. This will greatly increase the efficiency of all schemes
   considered. It is concluded that selection and varietal development
   increasingly evolve towards genotype building.}},

Abstract = {{Previous demonstrations that the dose, dose rate, radiation quality, and
   elapsed time since ionising radiation exposure result in variations in
   the response of stress genes suggest that gene expression signatures may
   be informative markers of radiation exposure. Defining sets of genes
   that are specific for different outcomes of interest will be key to such
   an approach. A generalised post-exposure profile may identify exposed
   individuals within a population, while more specific fingerprints may
   reveal details of a radiation exposure. Changes in gene expression in
   human cell lines occur after as little as 0.02 Gy gamma rays, and in
   peripheral blood lymphocytes after as little as 0.2 Gy. Diverse genes
   are also elevated in vivo in mice 24 h after 0.2 Gy irradiation. Ongoing
   microarray analyses meanwhile continue to identify large numbers of
   potential biomarkers from varied irradiation protocols, Development of
   computation-intensive informatics analysis methods will be needed for
   management of the complex gene expression profiles resulting from such
   experiments. Although the preliminary data are encouraging, significant
   work remains before meaningful correlations with risk or practical
   assessment of exposure can be made by gene expression profiling.}},

Abstract = {{In 1999 about 6208 radiation workers from 389 departments were monitored
   by CLOR in Poland. The distribution of annual personal doses shows that
   85\% of controlled workers received doses below the MDL (0.4 mSv) and
   about 97\% controlled workers received doses below 5 mSv. Doses higher
   than 50 mSv were received by three operators of industrial radiography
   units. The radiation workers under control are divided into four main
   work sectors: nuclear industry, research and education, medicine, and
   general industry. The average annual dose for all workers in each
   particular sector was 0.22 mSv, 0.22 mSv. 0.30 mSv and 0.80 mSv,
   respectively. ne average annual dose for the entire monitored population
   was 0.47 mSv. The average annual dose in each particular sector for
   number of workers receiving E > 0, i.e. H-p(10) greater than or equal to
   0.4 mSv, amounted to 1.78 mSv. 2.03 mSv, 1.88 mSv and 4.85 mSv.

Abstract = {{Twenty nuclear power plant workers with relatively high recorded
   cumulative doses were studied using FISH chromosome painting and
   dicentric analysis after solid Giemsa staining. The results indicated
   that chronic exposure to ionising radiation can be detected on the group
   level using translocation analysis after chromosome painting, although
   the mean cumulative dose was approximately 100 mSv. A significant
   association between translocation frequency and cumulative dose was
   observed. Variability in the translocation yields among workers with
   similar recorded doses was large, resulting in a poor correlation
   between translocation frequencies and documented doses on the individual
   level. The yields of dicentric and acentric chromosomes were not
   correlated with the cumulative dose, indicating the inability of
   unstable aberrations to monitor long-term exposures. It was also shown
   that the unstable aberrations were not correlated with the most recent
   annual dose.}},

Abstract = {{The forests of the Congo Basin in equatorial Africa are home to
   significant populations of gorillas and chimpanzees. However, numbers
   are declining owing to hunting and to alteration of their habitat.
   Gorillas and chimpanzees are particularly vulnerable for biological
   reasons: slow reproduction, prolonged developmental periods and complex
   social behaviour. In addition, their capacity to recover from
   disturbance is limited and the reinforcement of wild populations with
   captive-born individuals is rarely an option. Compared with the
   critically endangered mountain gorillas and the beleaguered chimpanzees
   in forest fragments in West Africa, there are some reasons for optimism
   about the future of the Congo Basin apes: levels of threat remain
   relatively low; and conservation of tropical rainforests has become a
   priority of the international community. At the same time, knowledge of
   the ecological needs of wild apes has increased and non-invasive
   techniques now exist to monitor population health. Sadly, no animals
   remain truly `wild', as their survival depends to a greater or lesser
   extent on management. Protected areas and laws that forbid hunting of
   vulnerable species are classic tools of management, but broader
   landscape visions are now emerging that may allow the Congo Basin to
   avoid the fragile scenario of larger animals persisting only in `island'
   parks.}},

Abstract = {{This study aims at estimating the effect of landscape composition on the
   availability of small mammal preys (in terms of biomass) to predators on
   a sectorial scale (n x 1 km(2)). Four study sites, representative of
   different stages of agriculture intensification, were selected in
   eastern France according to landscape composition.
   The population dynamics of Microtus arvalis, Arvicola terrestris,
   Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus sp. were monitored from 1992 to
   1996 by using index methods and trapping.
   M. arvalis and A. terrestris population biomasses were stable in
   landscapes with low percentage of permanent grassland. M. arvalis
   populations displayed greater biomass variations with sharp declines in
   the sites where the proportion of permanent grassland to farmland was
   greater than 50\%. A. terrestris populations were very unstable in one
   study site where the proportion of permanent grassland to farmland was
   greater than 85\%. Synchronic patterns between M. arvalis populations
   and the populations of hedgerow rodents were suspected at sites with
   large fluctuations of M. arvalis: every decline of the populations of
   hedgerow rodents was concomitant with the M. arvalis decline.
   These results suggest that two kinds of ecological systems in terms of
   prey-resource variations for mammalian predators can be distinguished:
   (i) stable in landscapes with lower proportion of permanent grassland,
   and (ii) unstable, with grassland species crashes and synchronous
   declines of the rodent community, in landscapes with higher proportion
   of permanent grassland.
   Moreover, the population dynamics of small mammals were asynchronous
   between the four sites situated at relatively short distance (some tens
   kilometres).}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted in a large (14,512 km(2)), Arctic, oligotrophic
   lake system, the River Paatsjoki watershed, which runs into the Barents
   Sea. There are no wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in this system.
   There are, however, wild, stocked or escaped populations of several
   salmonid species, which are all regarded as less susceptible to
   Gyrodactylus salaris than Atlantic salmon. The wild fish were exposed to
   G. salaris from an infected rainbow trout farm for a period of 1.5 to 2
   years during the seven-year monitoring period from 1993 to 1999
   (inclusive). The pectoral fins of 67 to 657 (mean 310) wild salmonids
   were examined annually for G. salaris. Low intensity infections of wild
   (escaped) rainbow trout were found in the vicinity of the infected farm.
   During the periods of infection on the farm the prevalence of G. salaris
   infection in the wild rainbow trout was higher than in the periods when
   the farm was not infected. Infected wild fish were found at most five
   months after the elimination of infection from the rainbow trout farm.
   Thus, the risk of a reservoir of G. salaris in the wild fish populations
   of the River Paatsjoki watershed was not concluded to be low at present.
   However, this situation is very different from the development of G.
   salaris infection in river systems, which have a reproducing Atlantic
   salmon population.}},

Abstract = {{Oriental meson, Cucumis melo L., grafted on Shintozoa (Cucurbit maxima x
   Cu. moschata) was transplanted in February in a plastic tunnel inside a
   greenhouse infested with Meloidogyne arenaria. Population dynamics of M.
   arenaria juveniles (J2) were monitored at monthly internals for 12
   months, and horizontal and vertical distribution of root systems and
   number of J2's in soil were examined in July. Soil J2 population
   dynamics displayed a single peak; nematode density increased slightly
   after planting but declined to 9/100 cm(3) soil at the 70th day after
   planting to increase again at the 100th day and this continued until the
   154th day to reach 3,817/100 cm(3). Thereafter, the population declined
   until December. Juveniles were distributed relatively uniformly
   horizontally over the 180 cm wide row. Maximum root length occurred at 0
   to 25 cm depth, and maximum root weight occurred in the top 5 cm of sail
   around the row center: The highest density of M. arenaria J2's was at 0
   to 25 cm soil depth, and only a few occurred at 40 to 50 cm. This study
   of M. arenaria on oriental melon under an intensive greenhouse
   cultivation system in Korea provides information for better
   understanding of root-knot nematode biology and population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Species preservation has permeated Swedish nature conservation. Pressure
   recently exerted on the Swedish National Board of Forestry by
   environmentalists has resulted in large-scale inventories of areas ('key
   habitats') that contain or are assumed to contain red-listed species.
   40,000 key habitat sites have been identified in forests with private
   ownership and a similar number is expected in company and state forests.
   The companies will themselves implement the inventories. Key habitat
   sites now appear to cover 0.8\% (some 200,000 ha) of the productive
   forest land. The protection and management of the key habitat site is,
   to a large extent. left to the individual owner. The inventories
   considered mainly the occurrence of bryophyte. fungal and lichen
   species, and the population or community concepts were not taken into
   account. There is therefore a lack of understanding of the key habitat
   sites as to extinction risks, successional trends, spatial population
   dynamics, and community interactions. Functional sites should be
   identified, probably based on some especially sensitive species in the
   communities. Some preliminary studies in a particular key habitat
   demonstrate great problems for conservation, e.g. with succession,
   species dependence on area and on specific habitat features. and an
   independence of the species richness of different taxa in various sites.
   Many key habitat sites cannot be left without some management if the
   species pool is to be preserved. Therefore. it is suggested that
   adaptive management with large-scale experimentation with buffer zones,
   corridors and supply of limiting resources be adopted. At the same time
   monitoring appears necessary to certify the persistence of
   representative species.}},

Abstract = {{A plethora of new concepts for managing production forests so as to
   preserve biodiversity have found their way into management procedures
   without much testing to make them most effective. The general framework
   fur a new approach has. in most regions. been ecosystem management,
   although small reserves are still used. as in the Swedish keg; habitat
   sites. Ecosystem management usually entails a focus on processes rather
   than on species directly. and the key processes in boreal forests are
   almost always seen as disturbances. Further. although such disturbances
   as insect and pathogen outbreaks. windstorms, and snow avalanches can be
   crucial, the concern has been almost wholly with fire. The idea that
   production forestry should mimic natural disturbance (fire) regimes is a
   step in the right direction but too simplistic. What needs to be
   determined is exactly which aspects of natural disturbance regimes are
   important to which species. Because different types of disturbance
   interact with one another. understanding the impacts on biodiversity of
   complex disturbance regimes will require experiments on a scale relevant
   to regional conservation. as well as intensive monitoring. So far. the
   effort on experimentation and monitoring is not nearly sufficient to
   generate detailed management prescriptions, although many management
   procedures already in place (e.g., retention of green trees and coarse
   woody debris) are probably useful.}},

Abstract = {{Wooden stakes and commercial Sentricon stations (Dow Agro-Sciences,
   Indianapolis, IN) were used to monitor seasonal activity and foraging
   location of Reticulitermes spp.(Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae), around 46
   residential structures in Kentucky. Termite activity in below-ground
   monitors was highest from spring through fall, with little activity
   during winter. Although certain parameters of the landscape (e.g.,
   shade, ground cover) were associated with a higher incidence of attack,
   results were inconsistent, suggesting that commercial bait installers
   will have difficulty predicting where termites are located underground.
   The findings also bring into question whether it is advisable to
   selectively install below-ground monitors around houses in areas
   arbitrarily deemed `conducive' to termite foraging. Established
   structural infestations of subterranean termites were, by visual
   determination, eliminated from 21 of 23 houses using hexaflumuron bait
   and the Sentricon (R) Colony Elimination System. De-infestation of one
   house was further confirmed by monitoring with an acoustic emission
   detector. The structures were subsequently protected for more than 3
   years by monitoring and re-baiting as needed.}},

   installed within the foraging area of 4 sites and the populations were
   baited with Recruit{*} II (Dow AgroSciences LLC, Indianapolis, IN)
   termite bait containing 0.5\% Hexaflumuron. These termite colonies were
   eliminated after consumption of 112.6g to 571.2g of bait matrix over a
   period of 3 to 11 months. Continuous monitoring and follow up baiting in
   the spring was needed to eliminate larger termite populations. At the
   remaining site, a single colony was eliminated using above ground bait
   placement alone. This population consumed 348.7g of bait matrix and
   required 15 months to eliminate all termite activity. The results
   demonstrate successful colony elimination if
   monitoring-baiting-monitoring procedures are followed carefully.}},

Abstract = {{The efficacy of the Sentricon(TM) Colony Elimination System containing
   Recruit(TM) II termite bait (Dow AgroSciences LLC, 0.5\% hexaflumuron)
   in controlling active subterranean termite infestations has been
   demonstrated in numerous studies. This baiting system and other termite
   baiting systems are now widely used, and generally accepted tools for
   remedial termite control in North America, Hawaii, and other parts of
   the world. The role of baiting systems in prevention of termite damages
   and long-term structural protection, however, is more controversial than
   their use in remedial control. We discuss three lines of evidence in
   support of the use of baits for long-term structural protection: (1)
   successful control of termite populations with baits in remedial studies
   allows a conceptual leap to preventative efficacy, since baits target
   colonies and populations and cannot be evaluated directly for prevention
   in the manner of soil insecticide barriers; (2) field and laboratory
   studies demonstrate that termite colonies feed on multiple resources and
   continue to radiate outward from each of those resources in search of
   additional food, increasing the likelihood of rapid bait discovery; and
   (3) results of our long-term field studies over the past decade
   demonstrate that newly invading termites will reuse existing galleries
   in the soil left by earlier colonies that lead to monitoring stations,
   were detected in monitoring stations, and were subsequently eliminated
   without any noticeable evidence of structural infestation or damage.}},

Abstract = {{In south-central Utah, lands within and adjacent to Capitol Reef
   National Park contain populations of nine rare plant species. In an
   effort to enhance the combined knowledge about these species, the Bureau
   of Land Management, the USDA Forest Service, and the National Park
   Service signed an Interagency Agreement and hired an interagency
   biologist and field crew to conduct field surveys for each of these
   species. Eight of these species are federally listed and one is a
   candidate for listing. Survey efforts, beginning in 2000 and continuing
   through 2002, will satisfy the inventory requirements of the recovery
   plans and conservation agreement for the nine species. The geology of
   this area has created conditions that have allowed unique plant species
   to evolve. The nine target species tend to be restricted to specific
   geologic formations. Prior to the field season, habitat modeling using
   geologic formations, elevation, slope, aspect, and plant community
   associates will be done to predict potential habitat for each species.
   This information is overlain with known populations, and areas are
   selected for field surveys. This inventory information will be used to
   develop monitoring and habitat management protocols. Monitoring will
   also be an interagency effort with locations throughout the range and in
   places appropriate to answer the specific questions for each species.}},

Abstract = {{Gilia caespitosa Gray (Rabbit Valley gilia) is a rare species restricted
   to scattered occurrences from the northern Waterpocket Fold to Thousand
   Lakes Mountain and Rabbit Valley in Wayne County, Utah. This species is
   a very narrow endemic, known only from unstable and faulting soils of
   detrital Navajo Sandstone. Species occurrences are often found with
   limited numbers of plants and minimal potential for increasing.
   Information available regarding historic abundance, ecology, biology,
   and demographics is limited. These factors contribute to the need to
   develop a Conservation Agreement and Strategy to provide the initial
   direction for conservation. Initial objectives of the strategy were to
   survey for additional occurrences and identify and establish management
   guidelines that would ensure the overall long-term survival of the
   species. Through an interagency effort, most of the initial conservation
   measures have been achieved. Results from these efforts include greatly
   expanded numbers of known population occurrences, refined monitoring

Abstract = {{Wright fishhook cactus (Sclerocactus wrightiae Benson) is a small barrel
   cactus endemic to the San Rafael Swell in south-central Utah. It was
   listed as an endangered species in 1979 due to its small population
   size, threats of over-collecting, and development associated with oil
   and gas. Demographic monitoring was initiated in 1993 with the following
   objectives: to establish permanent plots to monitor growth, fecundity,
   recruitment, and mortality for at least 10 years; to identify habitat
   factors positively associated with cacti presence; and to identify
   important insect visitors and predators. Three permanent plots were
   located throughout the range of S. wrightiae, and 93 individuals were
   followed from 1993 to 2000. In general, diameter size class was
   significantly different (P < 0.001) for all three plots. Size classes 3
   and 4 (adults) produced the greatest number of flowers and fruits. Size
   class 3 produced more flowers and fruits by virtue of its higher
   density, whereas size class 4 produced more flowers and fruits because
   of its larger diameter. Mortality exceeded recruitment by a 2.5:1 ratio
   for all plots. At Hanksville, 21 cacti (68\%) were recorded dead in
   1994, and the remaining 10 individuals and 5 recruits were recorded dead
   in 1995. No new recruits have been recorded since 1995 at Hanksville.
   Ord's kangaroo rats and white-tailed antelope ground squirrels were
   primary mortality sources at Hanksville, and the cactus-borer beetle was
   the primary mortality source at Giles and Mesa Butte.}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented of a 12-year monitoring program on the Coral Pink
   Sand Dunes and Sand Hills populations of the threatened Welsh's
   milkweed, Asclepias welshii N \& P Holmgren. The species is an early
   seral member of the dune flora, colonizing blowouts and advancing with
   shifting dunes. When an area stabilizes and other vegetation encroaches,
   A. welshii is crowded out. Reproduction is by seeds and rhizomes, with
   the latter being more important. Three growth forms and their
   significance in colony dynamics are recognized. Monitoring has measured
   fluctuations in stem counts, vegetative competition, off-road vehicle
   impacts, and the general instability of the environment.}},

Abstract = {{Yellow-flowered columbines (Aquilegia chrysantha Gray) are usually found
   in small, isolated populations near streams and pools in mountain ranges
   throughout the southwestern United States. To study the long-term
   dynamics of these populations, which are vulnerable to extinction, we
   have monitored the demography of a population in Fillmore Canyon in the
   Organ Mountains of southern New Mexico. Annual estimates of growth,
   survival, and reproduction were recorded for 2,152 individuals in 15
   one-meter square plots for 6 years. We estimated a seed bank survival
   rate from experimental plots and constructed annual size-structured
   transition matrices to determine population growth rates. Annual growth
   rates varied widely between 0.46 and 1.72 and were strongly correlated
   with spring precipitation. We calculated a weighted mean matrix, based
   on the historical frequency of spring rainfall events, resulting in a
   population growth rate of 1.02. The relationship between population
   growth rate and precipitation was used to calculate a mean growth rate
   from 75 years of recorded climate data and to project future growth
   rates under different climate conditions. These methods provide both an
   additional approach to modeling population persistence and a clearer
   understanding of the likelihood of extinction for a species dependent on
   mesic habitat in Fillmore Canyon.}},

   bradyi L. Benson have been monitored since 1985-86, Asclepias welshii N
   \& P Holmgren since 1989, and Cycladenia humilis Benth. var. jonesii
   Welsh \& Atwood since 1993. The two pediocactus species were monitored
   in plots where each cactus was tagged, measured for height or width, and
   mapped; how many cactus fruited and the mortality rate were also noted.
   Asclepias welshii plants were counted and mapped, and each stem was
   checked for follicles. Seedlings were also noted. The Cycladenia humilis
   var. jonesii were counted and checked for follicles in two plots. The
   size structure of Pediocactus sileri has shown a strong shift to the
   smaller size class from the mid-size class. Pediocactus bradyi has also
   shifted to the smaller individuals. The counts on the Cycladenia humilis
   var. jonesii and Asclepias welshii populations through the years have
   demonstrated ups and downs in population numbers, probably in line with
   precipitation amounts. Management plans have been implemented for the
   two pediocactus species to deal with the threats listed for the species:
   livestock trampling, off-road vehicle activity, mineral activity, and
   collection. There is a recovery plan for the Asclepias welshii (Welsh's
   milkweed), but not for the cyclad.}},

Abstract = {{Siler's pincushion cactus (Pediocactus sileri) occurs primarily on
   Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Washington and Kane Counties in
   southwestern Utah and across the border in northwestern Arizona. This 5
   year (1993-1997) monitoring study was set up as a challenge cost-share
   project between Red Butte Garden and the Utah State BLM Office in Salt
   Lake City. A permanent study plot was established about 10 miles east of
   Kanab, in Kane County, to annually monitor growth, reproduction,
   recruitment, mortality, and threats to the species. The cactus grew an
   average of 0.42 cm in height and 0.33 cm in width per year. Plants were
   about 10 years old before they produced fruit. Four demographic patterns
   were observed: (1) the total number of individuals nearly doubled, (2)
   the average annual recruitment rate was approximately four times greater
   than the average annual mortality rate, (3) the population appeared
   young, vigorous and viable, and (4) the cactus population may have
   responded to above-normal precipitation at the study site. Livestock and
   off-road vehicle tracks were observed in the study area but apparently
   are not major threats to the species. The Kane County population may be
   the most viable of all the populations currently under study in Utah and
   Arizona.}},

Abstract = {{One of the goals of conservation biology is to maintain the integrity of
   natural processes in populations of rare plants. In the short term one
   of the main concerns is often whether the mating system of rare plants
   is disrupted, for example, by fragmentation. In the long term one of the
   main concerns is often whether small isolated populations maintain
   enough genetic variation to respond to selection due to human-induced
   environmental changes. Management of rare plant populations would,
   therefore, be supported by tools enabling the effective monitoring of
   these and similar processes. Unfortunately, direct measures are often
   difficult, time consuming, or expensive to obtain and therefore not
   useful for monitoring efforts. We are developing some simple
   genetic-based methods for quantifying both mating systems and the
   expected response to selection. They rely on joint genetic and
   phenotypic data obtained from field-collected samples and obviate the
   need for intensive breeding designs and common gardens that typify
   quantitative genetic studies. As a result, they will be directly
   applicable to monitoring populations of rare plants, and will enable
   better efforts directed toward maintaining the integrity of natural
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{The fisheries for small pelagic fish are subject to large fluctuations
   in landings and hence are difficult to manage. The necessity of
   including environmental variability and its effects in monitoring and
   evaluation ofthese fisheries is well recognized. Comparative approaches
   used in modern fisheries science have identified temperature and
   wind-driven oceanographic features as the main physical mechanisms
   through which environmental variability affects changes in populations.
   In particular it appears that these oceanographic features play a key
   role in determining reproductive success. In this paper we attempt to
   link these physical and biological processes by designing functions that
   relate temperature and upwelling to spawning activity and explore the
   feasibility of integrating these functions into an information system
   for the Gulf of California sardine fishery. Specifically, we have
   derived double logistic functions relating spawning probability to sea
   surface temperature and an upwelling index and these functions are then
   used to compute a spawning probability timeseries. These functions may
   also provide estimates of annual landings. The second part of this paper
   explores the design of a geographical information system in which data
   on winds, satellite-derived temperatures, and pigment concentrations
   would be stored and used to calculate modeled individual-associated
   spawning probability leading to forecasts of spawning probability. If
   successful, this system could be applied to other regional resources.}},

Abstract = {{The total number of brown bears (Ursus arctos) in Europe is presently
   about 50,000 (about 14,000 outside Russia), within an area of more than
   2.5 million km(2) (800,000 km(2) outside Russia). About 37,500 bears are
   found in the northeastern European population; 8, 100 in the Carpathian
   Mountains; 2,800 in the Alps-Dinaric-Pindos; 1,000 in Scandinavia; 520
   in the Rila-Rhodope Mountains; 200 in the Stara Planina Mountains; 50-65
   in the western Cantabrian Mountains; 40-80 in Apennine Mountains; 20 in
   the eastern Cantabrian Mountains; 6 in the Western Pyrenees; 5 in the
   Central Pyrenees; and 4 in the southern Alps. The brown bear is either a
   protected or game species in all of the countries discussed in this
   paper. Most countries manage the brown bear at the national level,
   although several ministries are often involved. All European countries
   with bears within their national borders (except Bosnia and Herzegovina
   and the Yugoslav Federation) have signed the Bern Convention; almost
   half have prepared, or are preparing, a management plan for brown bears.
   In addition, most countries engage in monitoring, research, information
   dissemination, and conservation activities. In areas where bear range
   includes human settlements, damage to livestock, orchards, and beehives
   occurs but, in most countries, stakeholders are compensated for damage,
   either by the state, regional government, or hunter clubs. In 1995-96
   about 1.15 million US\$ was paid to compensate such damage throughout
   Europe.}},

Abstract = {{The brown bear (Ursus arctos) population in Estonia is a part of the
   large fragmented Eurasian population, constituting a piece of its
   north-westernmost branch. The large forested region in northeastern
   Estonia has been a core area for bears since the Holocene. Although half
   of the country is covered by forest, suitable habitats for bears are
   limited. Extensive forest clearance and human disturbance are major
   threats to Estonia's brown bear population. Counting and measuring of
   bear tracks have been used to monitor bear population in Estonia,
   resulting in a minimum estimate of 231 brown bears in 1998. Estimates
   based on reports from hunting organizations produced a number close to
   600. However, a methodology has yet to be developed that will yield
   reliable numbers. We are currently testing non-invasive sample
   collection methods, genetic identification, and mark-recapture models to
   analyze brown bear population size, density, and genetic variability.}},

Abstract = {{Within the framework of a European program of brown bear (Ursus arctos)
   restoration, 2 adult female brown bears were captured in May and June of
   1996 in Medved Reserve, Slovenia, and translocated to the central
   Pyrenees, France. The 2 females (Ziva and Mellba) were fitted with
   radiotransmitters and monitored from release to den entrance. After
   release from the same site, the bears were highly mobile and were
   located up to 55 km (Ziva) and 52 km (Mellba) from the release site.
   Their home ranges encompassed 1,233 km(2) (Ziva) and 796 km2 (Mellba)
   during this period. The 2 females used their home range in a multimodal
   fashion with areas of concentrated utilization. Ziva and Mellba. denned
   on 27 and 23 November 1996 and emerged on 19 and 4 April 1997,
   respectively. Denning sites were near the release site. These
   preliminary results suggest that translocation can be an effective
   technique to restore bear populations or to save small bear populations.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated statistical power for detecting trends of specified
   magnitude in visitation rate for American black bear (Ursus americanus)
   bait stations in Idaho and Washington. We found evidence for lack of
   independence due to multiple visits when bait stations were 0.8 km apart
   and no evidence for this with stations 1.6 km apart. Based on the
   variability observed in Idaho, we assessed power for several sets of
   criteria. The minimum criteria were a relative decline of 50\% over 3
   years at a = 0.20 and power = 0.80. These criteria were met for many of
   the Idaho surveys, but were generally not met in Washington. More
   stringent criteria of a decline of 25\% over 3 years at a = 0.10 and
   power = 0.90 were not met in either state. The initial visitation rate
   had a predominant influence on power, and in areas such as western
   Washington, where visitation was low but bear populations thought to be
   substantial, an effective monitoring program is contingent on improving
   the visitation rate through changes in survey methods. For long-term
   monitoring (5, 10, or 20 years), we estimated sampling requirements for
   declines of 50\%, 25\%, and 10\% with a = 0. 10 and power = 0.90 and
   estimated the costs of this sampling. Due to the inherent variability of
   bait station surveys, substantial sampling is required for detecting
   trends, and this method is likely to be cost effective only where
   visitation rates are relatively high. Although power analysis appears to
   be objective, determining the values for parameters used in its
   calculation is quite subjective and the results should be interpreted
   accordingly.}},

   tailings into Empress Augusta Bay on the west coast of Bougainville
   Island, Papua New Guinea. For a decade (1977-1987), trace elements (Cu,
   Pb, Zn, Cd, Hg and As) were measured in muscle tissue and organs of 8
   species of tropical marine fish common to both the east and west coasts
   of the Island. Metal concentrations were not elevated in muscle tissue
   of west fish compared with those from the east coast. Concentrations of
   Cu, Pb, Zn and Cd in fish muscle from both coasts ranged from 10-15\% of
   recommended maximum residue limits (MRLs), whereas concentrations of Hg
   in muscle were slightly higher, ranging up to less than or equal to 80\%
   of the MRL (0.5 mg kg(-1) Hg wet wt.). Maximum total As concentrations
   (3.6 mg kg(-1) wet wt.) were recorded in the shark (Rhizoprionodon
   acutus), while highest Hg values (0.76 mg kg(-1) wet wt.) were found in
   hammerhead sharks (Sphyrna lewini) from both coasts. Despite significant
   temporal variations in Hg and As concentrations in muscle tissue of some
   west coast fish populations (p < 0.05), there was no evidence for
   bioaccumulation or biomagnification of any of these metals during the 10
   yr period, even in the soft organs (liver and kidney) of fish. Several
   site specific factors contributing to absence of metals uptake from
   tailings are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study concerns the application of a sequencing batch reactor (SBR)
   for the posttreatment of an effluent rejected by an upflow anaerobic
   sludge blanket (UASB) reactor operating in a brewery. The goal was to
   achieve the required wastewater quality for discharge to surface water.
   The primary target was the removal of nitrogen compounds, but chemical
   oxygen demand and suspended solids were also concerns. Phosphorus
   concentration and protozoan population were also monitored during SBR
   operation. Two different strategies were tested: an operation based on
   an aerobic-anoxic sequence and another based on applying a
   predenitrification step, that is, an anoxic-aerobic-anoxic sequence.
   Ammonium (NH4-N) removal was achieved in all assays. Nitrification
   efficiency reached 97\%, and the maximum observed rate was 0.175 kg
   NH4-N/kg volatile suspended solids.d. A denitrification process was
   detected during the aerated periods, despite a dissolved oxygen
   concentration in the bulk liquid of 2.8 to 3.7 mg O-2/L. However,
   denitrification was suppressed when the bulk liquid oxygen concentration
   was increased to 7 mg O-2/L. The carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the UASB
   effluent was too low and hindered the postdenitrification phase. This
   fact was confirmed by complete nitrate removal when an acetate
   supplement was added. On the other hand, the insertion of a primary
   anoxic phase in the reaction cycle was the best treatment strategy,
   leading to nitrogen values within the legal framework. The protozoan
   population showed significant changes in response to the aerobic-anoxic
   conditions. However, periodic nonaerated conditions were not detrimental
   to aerobic protozoa, which recovered as soon as oxygen was again
   available.}},

Abstract = {{The environmental conditions and pathogen removal in macrophyte (Pistia
   stratiotes and Lemna paucicostata) and algal-based wastewater treatment
   systems were determined over a period of 29 days under tropical
   conditions. The experiment was conducted on a batch scale in 4.5 plastic
   containers immersed in moist sand beds. A control of raw sewage stored
   under dark conditions was included. Environmental conditions such as pH,
   temperature DO and conductivity and heterotrophic and faecal enterococci
   populations were monitored five times a week at 8, 12 and 20 GMT. BOD
   was monitored once a week for five weeks. Average temperatures within
   the systems ranged between 28.3 degreesC in the control to 30.6 degreesC
   In the algal-based system. Low pH levels of pH of 4.5 and DO levels of 3
   mg/L were recorded in the water lettuce treatment systems. High pH
   levels around 10.5 and DO levels of about 20 mg/L were observed in the
   algal-based system. The control and duckweed system remained neutral.
   All treatment systems performed equally well fn pathogen removal and BOD
   reduction. The BOD decreased from 130mg/L to 5.0, 7.5, 10 and 15 mg/L in
   the duckweed, water lettuce, control and algal based treatment systems
   respectively. The faecal enterococci population decreased from
   1.18x10(5) /ml to values below 100/ml in all treatment systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Big Blue River Basin is located in southeastern Nebraska and
   northeastern Kansas and consists of surface water in the Big Blue River,
   Little Blue River, Black Vermillion River, and various tributaries
   draining 24,968 km(2). Approximately 75\% of the land area in the basin
   are cultivated cropland. The Big Blue River flows into Tuttle Creek
   Reservoir near Manhattan, Kansas. Releases from the lake are used to
   maintain streamflow in the Kansas River during low flow periods,
   contributing 27\% of the mean flow rate of the Kansas River at its
   confluence with the Missouri River. Tuttle Creek Reservoir and the
   Kansas River are used as sources of public drinking water and meet many
   of the municipal drinking water supply needs of the urban population in
   Kansas from Junction City to Kansas City. Elevated concentrations of
   pesticides in the Big Blue River Basin are of growing concern in Kansas
   and Nebraska as concentrations may be exceeding public drinking water
   standards and water quality criteria for the protection of aquatic life.
   Pesticides cause significant problems for municipal water treatment
   plants in Kansas, as they are not appreciably removed during
   conventional water treatment processes unless activated carbon filtering
   is used. Pesticides have been detected during all months of the year
   with concentrations ranging up to 200 mug/l. If high concentration in
   water is associated with high flow conditions then large mass losses of
   pesticides can flow into the water supplies in this basin. This paper
   will investigate the use of a monitoring program to assess the non-point
   source of this atrazine contamination. Several practices will be
   examined that have shown ability to remediate or prevent these
   impairments.}},

Abstract = {{The Laguna de Bay is the largest lake in the Philippines and is situated
   15 km southeast of the centre of Metropolitan Manila. The population of
   the capital region is growing out of proportion, especially in the
   watershed area of the lake. This development is endangering the resource
   Laguna de Bay due to the increasing discharge of nutrient and suspended
   solid loads from the drainage basin into the lake. During the EU-funded
   project ``Laguna de Bay, Philippines An Ecosystem Approach for
   Sustainable Management{''} a monitoring campaign on selected tributary
   rivers was conducted. Based on the results of this monitoring and an
   analysis of census data, the total annual loads were estimated at about
   8000 t N, 2300 t P and 160,000 t TSS. The occurrence of the typhoon
   ``Loleng{''} in the research area during the monitoring campaign made it
   possible to state that about 25\% of the annual load is drained during
   such a weather situation.}},

Abstract = {{In order to check the sludge reduction capacity of metazoa in a membrane
   bioreactor (MBR), pilot-scale studies were conducted. Three MBRs had
   been set in a wastewater treatment plant at Tokyo, Japan and they were
   receiving real wastewater. Initially pH inside the three MBRs was
   controlled as pH 7, 6 and 5 respectively. Then metazoa population was
   monitored along with MLSS change. It was found that the presence or
   absence of the metazoa population did not have any significant effect on
   the increasing pattern of MLSS. In the MBR with pH 6 highest
   accumulation of sludge was observed though a high and steady level of
   metazoa (1,000-2,000 per ml) was present there. But in this MBR a lot of
   metazoa attached in the membrane was also observed and here the increase
   in transmembrane pressure was less than in the other two. So, metazoa
   population especially the attached one in the membrane plays an
   effective role in fouling control of the membrane. Presence of attached
   media may provide a suitable niche for metazoa in the process. So,
   attached media known as DB lace was also inserted in MBRs for testing
   its capacity along with inoculum of oligochaete worms. Accumulation of
   sludge was not satisfactory in the attached string and it seems that
   inoculated worm could not adjust to the environment as they were not
   sludge originated. So, in the next experimental stage, attached media
   was inserted in the form of a bundle and this time no inoculation of
   worm was used. A steady metazoa population was observed in the system
   but the accumulation of sludge in the attached media was the same as
   before.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen pollution above a threshold level induces a eutrophication
   process in coastal creek ecosystems and consequently impacts on the
   water quality. The remedy for this scenario is the introduction of
   methods to enhance oligotrophication by means of constructed wetlands
   and buffer zones. This paper discusses new data on nitrogen flux and
   population changes in the primary consumers in the Bradley Creek
   ecosystem, adjacent to the Duck Haven Golf Course in southeastern North
   Carolina. In 1998-99, over different seasons, density distribution of
   the field populations of the fiddler crab Uca minax, was monitored as an
   indicator of environmental health. A control site at Whiskey Creek,
   adjacent to the University Center for Marine Sciences, was monitored in
   the same period since this site is not influenced by any golf course
   nutrient flux. The results pointed out that threshold level for optimum
   population density in Spartina grandiflora salt marsh is 0.1 mg/L of
   nitrates. A dense crab population, adjacent to the golf course with a
   buffer zone, was indicative of restoration of the estuarine ecosystem. A
   model, involving the use of constructed wetlands for oligotrophication,
   is being prepared on the basis of studies conducted by the University of
   South Alabama for a stormwater wetland constructed adjacent to the
   university's golf course.}},

Abstract = {{The acclimatisation of an activated sludge to enhanced biological

   bioaugmentation with a low amount of phosphorus-accumulating sludge.
   Phosphorus removal yields were monitored by conventional analytical
   methods and microbial communities evolutions were followed by a finger
   printing molecular technique (PCR-SSCP). While the benefit of the
   bioaugmentation seems real at the level of the reactor parameters,
   bioaugmentation speeded up the installation of good and stable
   phosphorus removal yield, the establishment of the inoculated microbial
   community in the bioaugmented reactor is still unclear. Both the
   bioaugmented and the control microbial communities evolved in a similar
   way to end up with apparently comparable populations. At the time of the
   experiment, the results suggest that the microbial community inoculated
   for the bioaugmentation did not establish in the reactor but compensated
   for phosphorus accumulation until the acclimatisation of an endogenous
   microbial community arose.}},

Abstract = {{Wastewater reuse raises the question of health risk and the
   epidemiological surveys needed. An epidemiological and environmental
   approach was used to check the security for the exposed populations
   surrounding and agricultural population in Clermont-Ferrand. Four
   information systems were set up: two sentinel systems joining general
   physicians (15) and pharmacists (7) for the surrounding population and
   two follow-up surveys among field workers and farmers. Water quality
   monitoring and a study of aerosols from spray irrigation were performed.
   No epidemic event was identified with only some case clusters (not
   related to water exposure) being observed. All the declared cases were
   benign. The workers' survey underlined a substantial incidence of nettle
   rashes, itchy skins, sunburns, and cuts. The follow-up study among
   farmers and their families did not reveal any particular phenomena. The
   bacteriological quality of treated wastewater throughout conformed with
   the recommendations of the Superior Council of Public Health of France
   (1,000 faecal coliforms/100 mL). No faecal bacteria were observed in
   aerosols with water concentrations equal to 10(3) cfu/100mL and an
   exposure time of 20 min. The survey of such an irrigation system,
   towards potential and actual risks, required the conjunction of
   different epidemiological information sources and microbiological data.}},

   advantage of a biologically more appropriate observation of the biomass
   by only taking into account the viable cells in the population. The
   optimal measurement frequency of the biomass monitoring device for the
   given experimental conditions has been determined. Furthermore, the
   capacitance readings have been correlated with off-line analyses of dry
   weight of the sludge during the experimental phase in which no death of

   cormorant nests in the study area peaked in mid;Tune, while Great
   Black-backed and Herring gulls peaked in late May and early June,
   respectively. Peak nesting dates generally were consistent for each
   island across years, but varied by up to a month between islands during
   a given year. A 10-year monitoring program using annual surveys
   conducted between 23 May and 23 June, or biennial surveys conducted from

Abstract = {{Walked line transects were evaluated for estimating nocturnal densities
   of red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) and the red-bellied
   pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) in a range of open and closed
   habitats. The use of cleared transect lines in densely vegetated
   habitats reduced noise produced by travelling, while permanent grid
   markers facilitated collection of perpendicular distance data at night.
   Results from sighting histograms indicated that animals did not display
   evasive movement in response to the observer before detection. The
   probabilities of detecting the macropod species varied significantly
   between habitats. Significant differences in probabilities of detection
   were also recorded within species between habitats. Consequently,
   line-transect sampling is recommended over strip-transect sampling for
   estimating species abundance when more than one species and/or habitat
   are of interest. Recommendations are made, however, for forest managers
   wanting to monitor macropod populations on newly established
   plantations, when line-transect sampling is not feasible and
   strip-transect sampling is the only alternative.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews field methods for estimating and monitoring the
   abundance of terrestrial carnivores that do not involve capture.
   Effective methods of monitoring abundance are important tools for the
   management and conservation of many species. The development of methods
   for carnivores presents particular challenges, as they are often
   secretive and widely dispersed. Nevertheless, a variety of approaches
   based on direct observations and quantification of field signs have been
   employed. These techniques are described in relation to carnivore
   ecology and resource implications, and the advantages and deficiencies
   of each are discussed with reference to case studies.}},

Abstract = {{During this study, 634 eastern hoseshoe bats, Rhinolophus megaphyllus,
   were captured at three colonies in south-east Queensland, with most data
   coming from two colonies (Anjuramba mine and Ravensbourne cave). Colony
   size, sex ratios, age structure, and colony function varied between
   colonies and with season. Capture-recapture data of banded bats was used
   to monitor movement patterns, seasonal weight changes, colony-size
   estimates at Anjuramba (JOLLY model), and the recapture frequency
   according to sex and age. The JOLLY estimator of the population size
   over-estimated the actual population at Anjuramba on most occasions but
   paralleled changes in population size. Of the 319 bats banded, 21.9\%
   were recaptured, with only one recovery involving a movement between
   roosts. Adult males have a high roost-site fidelity and are more
   sedentary than adult females. The recapture rate and recapture frequency
   for adult males was significantly higher than for adult females. R.
   megaphyllus is active throughout the year but may enter torpor for short
   periods, with more females than males observed in torpor. There was no
   significant association between torpor and season. Longevity records of
   7 years and 1 month were recorded for a sub-adult female and 7 years and
   7 months for a juvenile female.}},

Abstract = {{Nine phascogales (7 females, 2 males) were radio-tracked between March
   and July 1999 to investigate the spatial organisation of this species in
   spatially limited habitat near Euroa, Victoria. In this area,
   approximately 3.6\% of the original woodland vegetation remains after
   150 years of agricultural clearing. Most wooded habitat is confined to
   narrow linear strips along roads and streams. However, these remnants
   are on fertile soils and, because they have not experienced intensive
   harvesting, the density of large old trees is over 10 times that found
   in nearby State Forests and Parks. Female phascogales were monitored for
   13-38 days over periods of 5-15 weeks. The size of home ranges of
   females was 2.3-8.0 ha, and averaged 5.0 ha. This value is one-eighth
   the mean home-range size previously recorded for the species in
   contiguous forest in Victoria. All individuals used multiple nest trees,
   with nests generally located in trees >80 cm diameter at breast height.
   Although fragmented and spatially limited, the stands of large old trees
   on productive soils near Euroa provide a network of well connected,
   high-quality habitat for phascogales. The relatively dense population of
   phascogales in these remnants suggests that prior to agricultural
   clearing and timber harvesting, phascogales may have been much more
   common in Victoria than at present.}},

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{547-554}},
Abstract = {{In the Northern Territory of Australia, populations of the estuarine
   crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) have been subject to an annual egg
   harvest since the early 1980s. Since 1997, adult and juvenile crocodiles
   have also been harvested in some catchments. Annual surveys of crocodile
   populations are conducted in order to ensure that the harvest is
   sustainable. Boat surveys commenced in 1975 and helicopter surveys
   commenced in 1989. Retrospective power analysis was used to determine
   whether the sampling program meets the objectives of the Crocodile
   Management Program for the Northern Territory. Data collected during
   boat surveys vary in quality between river systems. The analysis of
   pooled data from 7 river systems with a residual standard deviation of
   0.11 indicates that the power of the current spotlight survey method to
   detect a decline of 10\% per annum in around 4 years is about 0.9. In
   this time the population would decline by around 33\% and would fully
   recover in 8 years following the removal of the factor causing the
   decline. This allows detection of a decline within one-third, and
   recovery within two-thirds, of the estimated generation time of the
   saltwater crocodile and will allow management actions to be implemented
   before the impacts on populations are serious. The data from helicopter
   and boat surveys from a 10-year period were compared. Helicopter surveys
   did not provide useful management information.}},

Title = {{Survival of red-capped robins (Petroica goodenovii) in woodland remnants

Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{565-571}},
Abstract = {{To determine relative survival rates of small birds occupying small,
   linear strips of woodland compared with large patches of woodland,
   marked populations of red-capped robins were monitored over a two-year
   period. In total, 196 male robins were banded with unique colour
   combinations in 10 woodland remnants and censused by song playback at
   half-yearly intervals. The Cormack-Jolly-Seber method was used to
   calculate half-yearly survival probabilities for birds in the two
   habitat configurations and the strongest model included separate
   survival parameters for summer (36.2\% +/- 5.1) and autumn (88.9\% +/-
   13.5) half-years, but a constant recapture probability (50.5\% +/- 7.2).
   The inclusion of separate parameters for the large and linear habitat
   configurations reduced the strength of the model, indicating that there
   was no significant difference between the survival rates of birds
   occupying small, linear strips of woodland and birds occupying large
   patches of woodland. The mean annual survival, determined by multiplying
   the half-yearly survival probabilities, was 32\%, which is low, compared
   with the annual survival of other Petroica robins. Although no banded
   birds were located away from the banding site, we suspect that much of
   the `mortality' represented emigration during the summer half-year.
   Under this scenario a better estimate of annual survival (79\%) might be
   achieved by extrapolation of survival over the winter half-year. This
   study provides no data to support the contention that adult mortality is
   higher in small, linear strips of habitat, although further data on the
   fate of birds that disappear from remnants is required before this is
   conclusive. In addition, to detect a 20\% difference in survival using
   similar methods to the present study, with their accompanying sources of
   variation, at least 10 times the number of birds would need to be
   monitored. This might most effectively be done as a co-operative banding
   project.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat and spatial organisation of 11 radio tagged Eurasian lynxes Lynn
   lynx Linnaeus, 1758 were studied in a low-density (ca 0.3 ind/100 km(2))
   population in a boreal-alpine environment with low and temporally
   varying densities (less than or equal to 180 ind/100 km(2) in winter) of
   ungulate prey, primarily roe deer and semi-domestic reindeer. The use of
   habitat measured as 4 biome categories ranked from south boreal to
   alpine influenced mountain vegetation did not vary seasonally, but
   lowlands were much preferred to alpine habitats. Adult males moved
   almost 3 times farther per day in linear distance ((x) over bar = 5.9
   km, n = 3) than did females with kittens ((x) over bar = 2.0 km, n = 4)
   or subadult females ((x) over bar = 2.5 km, n = 6; p = 0.002). Subadults
   (n = 5) dispersed 42 +/- 13 ((x) over bar +/- SE) km during the first 9
   months of independence, but often visited their natal range during the
   first year on their own. Adult lynxes roamed over very large annual
   ranges {[}males: 1906 +/- 387 km(2) (n = 4), females: 561 +/- 102 km(2)
   (n = 6)] that took greater than or equal to 5 days to pass through,
   independently of sex. The only male monitored over more than 1 year
   maintained 2 separate home ranges each year. The larger home ranges and
   the possible tendency towards less defined territory boundaries than
   previously reported for the species, may be caused by the lower prey and
   population densities, though culling of adult individuals may also have
   played a role by continuously. creating empty gaps in the territorial
   mosaic.}},

Abstract = {{Shifts in the driving forces for agricultural production and
   agro-ecosystem processes require a re-examination of the links between
   research and policy making. The major driving forces shaping global
   change impacts on food and agricultural production in the future will be
   appreciably different from those prevailing when the global change and
   terrestrial ecosystems (GCTE) programme was setup in 1984. Population
   growth and technological change aimed at raising yields were the main
   driving forces in the 1980s, Future driving forces, however, will be
   centred on income growth, shifts in consumption patterns and
   technological change shared by environmental objectives and social
   concerns operating through the market, e.g., pollution taxes on
   fertilisers and pesticides, and consumer resistance to genetically
   modified crops, respectively. It follows, therefore, that global change
   impacts on food and agricultural production will increasingly be the
   consequence of interactions between bio-physical and socio-economic
   processes rather than predominantly by the former as is assumed by many
   GCTE activities.
   These shifts in driving forces point to the need for a reassessment of
   the policy context of global change research, and of the multiple roles
   that science can play in the policy process. It is important at the
   outset of research project formulation to consider how science can
   contribute to each stage of the policy process, and particularly to:
   problem identification: strategy formulation; selection of policy
   options; policy implementation; setting of regulatory standards;
   monitoring and evaluation.
   This paper provides such an assessment and puts forward a number of
   principles for policy relevant science. For example: broad consultation
   in identifying and defining the issues; greater inter-disciplinarity
   because of the erowing importance of socio-economic factors. It
   highlights a number of issues and research opportunities. These include
   the current difficulties of scaling up from GCTE plot observations and
   transects so that they provide meaningful inputs to the analysis of
   global issues and the greater use of matrix analysis and similar tools
   to key science and policy linkages. It is not enough for the
   International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme and GCTE to promote leading
   edge science. They need to enhance the role that policy needs and
   socio-economic factors play in setting scientific agenda. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Exploiting the principles of biological controlof crop pests is an
   important management strategy for the resource-poor smallholder farmers
   of the tropics. The effects of nine hedgerow species on the abundance of
   major insect pests of beans and maize, and predatory/parasitic-
   arthropods were monitored over two cropping seasons and the intervening
   dry period. The tree/shrub species evaluated were Gliricidia sepium,
   Grevillea robusta, Senna siamea, Senna spectabilis, Flemingea congesta,
   Croton megalocarpus, Morus alba, Calliandra calothyrsus and Lantana
   camara. Arthropod abundance was monitored through counts of infested
   plants and using yellow pan and pitfall traps. Beanfly (Ophiomyia spp.)
   infestation was significantly higher in the presence of hedgerows (35\%)
   than in their absence (25\%). Hedgerows did not influence aphid (Aphis
   fabae) infestation of beans. In contrast, maize associated with
   hedgerows experienced significantly lower stalk borer (Busseola fusca
   and Chilo spp.) and aphid (Rhophalosiphum maidis) infestations than pure
   maize, the margin of difference being 13\% and 11\% respectively for the
   two pests. Ladybird beetles closely followed their prey, aphids, with
   significantly higher catches in sole cropped-plots than in
   hedgerow-plots and away from hedgerows. Activity of wasps was
   significantly greater close to hedgerows than away from them. Spider
   catches during maize season were 77\% greater in the presence of
   hedgerows than in their absence, but catches during other seasons were
   similar between the two cropping systems. Differences among hedgerow
   species were not significant for most of the arthropods monitored,
   except that beanfly infestation was greater with Gliricidia hedgerows.
   The study indicates that the effect of hedgerows on pest infestations of
   crops and their role as refugia for predators cannot be generalized but
   depends on the specific arthropods.}},

Abstract = {{Most investigations of altitudinal zonation of river macrobenthic
   communities have been conducted in the northern hemisphere. Conversely,
   South American habitats, and specifically the Argentinean ones, are
   poorly known. This is the first study of altitudinal zonation of
   macrobenthic communities in the Patagonian Andes. It was carried out at
   14 sampling stations along 51 km of the Esquel-Percy River system over a
   1000 m altitudinal gradient. Untreated sewage of Esquel City discharges
   in the middle section of the system. The main species assemblages of the
   monitored sites were identified and a functional categorization of the
   taxa was produced. Population distribution patterns were analyzed
   throughout a complete annual cycle, and both qualitative and
   quantitative variations were interpreted as a function of abiotic and
   biotic variables. The macrobenthic community found along the
   Esquel-Percy system is rich and diverse, except at middle-stretch
   stations, which are altered by anthropogenic perturbations. Specific
   composition, diversity and density were influenced by the topographic
   gradient, geochemical (conductivity and total alkalinity) and
   anthropogenic factors (BOD and oxygen saturation), and the seasonality
   of the system. Similarities with lotic environments of Australia and New
   Zealand were found in specific composition, density, and community
   structure. The biomass of shredders and predators decreased, while
   collectors increased, downstream from the headwaters.
   Collector-gatherers were the most important group at all sites.
   Functional organization showed better correspondence with the RCC model
   if biomass was used instead of macroinvertebrate density. We found that
   local and regional characteristics produced deviations from the RCC
   model, but it is still useful as a comprehensive framework for stream
   ecology in the Patagonian Andes.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1992 and 1998, 869 ringed seals taken in the subsistence harvest
   in western Prince Albert Sound were sampled by two Inuvialuit seal
   monitors from Holman, Northwest Territories. Considering the 1992-98
   data along with data from 1971-78, we found that the mean body-mass
   index (BMI) values for females (greater than or equal to 7 yr) were
   significantly lower in 1974 than in all other years examined. At the
   same time, ovulation rates fell from 100\% in 1971 and 1972 to lows of
   42.9\% ( 1974) and 64.3\% (1975), with a return to 93.8\% in 1976.
   Mature females that had ovulated had significantly higher BMI values
   than those that had not ovulated. In eastern Amundsen Gulf, 1974 was the
   most severe ice year on recent record, with the latest date of clearing
   of the landfast ice (6 September), the earliest date of new ice
   formation (4 October), and the fewest number of open water days (28
   days). There were no years between 1992 and 1998 that compared to 1974
   in reduced ovulation rates, reduced body condition, or severity of ice
   conditions. Between 1992 and 1998, mean BMI values for adult females and
   males were lowest in 1994 and highest in 1998, and all annual mean BMI
   values were between the extremes of the 1970s. This variation in
   condition in the 1990s did not coincide with a reduction in ovulation
   rates of mature females, which remained high (93.5-100\%) from 1992 to
   1998. In 1998, the landfast ice cleared 43 days earlier than the average
   clearing date for the 1990-98 period, apparently interrupting the
   lactation period for seal pups located at the periphery of the core
   breeding habitat. The apparent effects on growth and condition of
   unweaned pups came at a time when marine food appeared to be abundant
   and available to all age classes of ringed seals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a population viability analysis (PVA) for Euphorbia
   clivicola R.A. Dyer, a threatened succulent confined to only two known
   populations in the Northern Province of South Africa, one of which is
   protected in a nature reserve. The PVA explicitly compared the relative
   effectiveness of four management scenarios in bringing about the
   recovery of the protected population that had shown a 91\% decline over
   the decade during which the population was monitored. Demographic
   monitoring data as well as autecological data collected in 1996 were
   used to determine the temporal variation in observed demographic and
   reproductive parameters. The model parameters were allowed to vary
   randomly over the observed ranges in order to incorporate stochasticity
   of the environmental factors fire, herbivory and rainfall. If future
   management practices remain unchanged, the model predicted that there is
   an 88\% probability of the protected population becoming extinct within
   the next 20 years. The population should recover under a management
   scenario involving a fire frequency of every 3 years, the exclusion of
   herbivores and augmentation. The model has since been validated with
   data collected in 1999. Such analyses are useful for adaptive management
   purposes. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are many aspects of coral disease that are poorly understood. The
   relationship, if any, between human activities and the incidence of
   coral disease is particularly important since it is frequently assumed
   that the number and prevalence of diseases are increasing, and are
   indicative of a general decline in the marine environment. Certainly a
   good understanding of these issues would assist in the conservation of
   coral reefs by identifying targets for mitigating management programmes.
   In situ observations of coral disease and associated mortality were
   therefore compiled from more than 150 sources, and reviewed. Although
   there have been cases where disease has caused major changes in the
   composition and structure of reefs, most notably in the Caribbean, these
   are exceptions when compared to the number of locations at which disease
   has been observed. With the exception of white-band disease, most
   frequently observed diseases do not appear to be specific in their host
   requirements, affecting species in many different genera. The
   overwhelming majority of disease in the Caribbean (97\% of locations)
   has been recorded from coral reefs where human activities are expected
   to have medium to high impacts. Regional scale patterns in the incidence
   of coral disease may therefore be suitable bio-indicators of disturbance
   to coral reefs. This potential relationship should be investigated
   further with a view to using patterns of disease to monitor specific
   sources of stress on reefs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recently, coyotes (Canis latrans) have expanded their range to include
   most areas of the southeastern United States. However, most research on
   coyotes has been conducted in western and northern regions of North
   America. We radio-monitored 38 adult coyotes from 1993 to 1997 in
   central Mississippi. Home-range sizes (P = 0.681) and core-area (area of
   concentrated use) sizes (P = 0.736) were similar across seasons, but
   females maintained larger home ranges (P = 0.006) and core areas (P <
   0.001) than males. Male-male, female-female, and male-female home-range
   overlap was greatest during whelping and pup rearing. Except for mated
   pairs, core-area overlap was negligible across all seasons for adults
   maintaining neighboring home ranges. Coyote habitat selection varied
   across spatial scales, though selection was similar between males and
   females at all scales. Coyote movement rates differed (P < 0.001)
   temporally, being highest during nocturnal periods. Overall, the highest
   movement rates for the monitored population were observed for females
   during summer. Two males and 2 females were suspected of forming pair
   bonds and frequently traveled together within shared home ranges, as did
   2 adult males. Our data indicate that interactions among individual
   adults are influenced by sex, as most confirmed instances of direct
   contact occurred between pairs or suspected social groups. In our study
   area, neighboring adult coyotes exhibited territoriality at the
   core-area level.}},

Abstract = {{If is necessary to assess whether the management of protected areas is
   achieving the objectives set for them. In particular, changes and trends
   in wildlife populations should be documented. We compared the 1990
   abundance of mammals in two Costa Rican protected areas Corcovado
   National Park (CNP) and Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve (GDFR), with similar
   environmental characteristics bat different hunting restrictions and
   levels of protection. We also monitored the abundance of mammals in CNP
   over a 4-year period. We also devised an inexpensive method of
   monitoring tropical rainforest mammal populations in a timely and
   efficient manner. The method is based on the use of mammal track records
   and arboreal mammal sightings and requires little effort. With this
   method 20 mammal species were recorded at CNP and 15 at GDFR. Species
   were consistently less abundant in GDFR than in CNP, principally those
   species preferred by hunters. Species were grouped according to whether
   or not they are used as food and whether they are locally or globally
   threatened or not threatened. The abundance of all these groups of
   species in GDFR was 6-28\% the abundance in CNP. During 1990-1994,
   overall mammal abundance in CNP remained relatively stable, but there
   was considerable variability among species. As a group, both species
   used for food and globally threatened species declined in abundance
   during that period in CNP. The abundance of all groups of species
   declined from 1992 to 1994, coinciding with a reduction in hunting
   vigilance at CNP. Evidence suggests that the main factor differentiating
   the abundance of mammals in the two protected areas, and at CNP during
   the study period, was the level of hunting. Golfo Dulce Forest Reserve
   seems to be achieving only partial success in protecting wildlife,
   whereas Corcovado National Park seems to be considerably more effective,
   although not entirely successful.}},

Abstract = {{We studied local patterns of Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater)
   abundance parasitism rates and nest success of a common host the
   Plumbeous Vireo (Vireo plumbeus), in relation to the distribution of
   livestock grazing in an undeveloped region of northeastern New Mexico,
   1992-1997. We predicted that both cowbird abundance and parasitism rates
   of vireo nests would decrease with inn-easing distance from active
   livestock grazing, and that the nesting success of vireos would
   increase. We measured cowbird abundance and host density and located and
   monitored vireo nests in pinyon-juniper and mixed-conifer habitats that
   ranged from actively grazed to isolated from livestock grazing by up to
   12 km. Cowbird abundance declined with distance from active livestock
   grazing and was not related to host density or. habitat type. Brood
   parasitism levels of vireo nests (n = 182) decreased from >80\% in
   actively grazed habitats to 33\% in habitats that were 8-12 km from
   active grazing but did not vary by habitat type or distance to forest
   edge. Vireo nesting success was higher in mixed-conifer habitat than in
   pinyon-juniper but was unrelated to distance from active livestock
   grazing. Nest losses due to parasitism declined with distance from
   active livestock grazing. Our results suggest that cowbird abundance and
   parasitism rates of bests may be distributed as a declining gradient
   based on distance from cowbird feeding sites and that isolation from
   feeding sites can reduce the effects of parasitism on host populations.
   These findings provide support for management techniques that propose to
   reduce local cowbird numbers and parasitism levels by manipulating the
   distribution of cowbird feeding sites. The presence of parasitized nests
   >8 km from active livestock grazing suggests that in some regions,
   management efforts may need to occur at larger scales than previously
   realized.}},

Abstract = {{An Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management workshop process was
   used to assist Grand Canyon scientists and managers in developing
   conceptual and simulation models for the Colorado ecosystem affected by
   Glen Canyon Dam. This model examines ecosystem variables and processes
   at multiple scales in space and time, ranging from feet and hours for
   benthic algal response to diurnal flow changes, to reaches and decades
   for sediment storage and dynamics of long-lived native fish species. Its
   aim is to help screen policy options ranging from changes in hourly
   variation in flow allowed from Glen Canyon Dam, to major structural
   changes for restoration of more natural temperature regimes. It appears
   that we can make fairly accurate predictions about some components of
   ecosystem response to policy change (e.g., autochthonous primary
   production, insect communities, riparian vegetation, rainbow trout
   population), but we are moderately or grossly uncertain about others
   (e.g., long-term sediment storage, response of native and non-native
   fishes to physical habitat restoration). Further, we do not believe that
   existing monitoring programs are adequate to detect responses of native
   fishes or vegetation to anything short of gross habitat changes. Some
   experimental manipulations (such as controlled floods for
   beach/habitat-building) should proceed, but most should await
   development of better monitoring programs and sound temporal baseline
   information from those programs.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the relationships between landscape composition
   and the population dynamics of the fossorial water vole Arvicola
   terrestris. Land use patterns were studied based on agricultural and
   forestry data from the French Ministry of Agriculture collected in 1955
   and 1988. In the Massif Central. France, water vole populations were
   monitored from 1985 to 1993 by using index methods. Outbreaks of water
   vole populations occurred in many dispersed epicentres and spread
   suddenly and widely over > 7500 km(2). At a regional scale, the
   fluctuation lasts six years on average with an outbreak period lasting
   from two to three years. Density variation patterns are positively
   correlated with the proportion of permanent grassland to agricultural
   land. A high risk of outbreak is linked to a high proportion of
   permanent grassland (over 90\%), whereas a low risk of outbreak is
   linked to a proportion of < 80\%. Conversely. density variation patterns
   are negatively correlated with the proportion of temporary grassland to
   agricultural land and with the proportion of forest to total land in the
   western (major) part of the study area. Temporary grassland thus appears
   to be a marginal habitat for water voles and extensive forests could act
   as a brake on outbreaks. The increase in the area of permanent grassland
   from 1955 to 1988 was apparently the major cause of chronic high
   densities of water voles. Therefore. land use and landscape management
   could be one way to control water vole outbreaks.}},

Title = {{Landscape and fragment size effects on reproductive success of
   forest-breeding birds in Ontario}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1749-1761}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To determine the minimum size requirements and influence of landscape
   context on reproductive success of forest-breeding songbirds, we
   monitored nesting success of five species of songbirds on 40 fragments
   (12-2350 ha in total woodlot size) and two continuous forest sites in
   south-central Ontario from 1994 through 1997. Woodlot size was the most
   important variable contributing to differences in reproductive success,
   with local forest cover (within a 10-km radius) having no significant
   additional effect on productivity for any species. For all species,
   except Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceous), adult female reproductive
   success was at or above replacement levels in large fragments (mean of
   121 ha core area, 849 ha woodlot area) and continuous forest, and below
   replacement levels in small fragments (mean of 7.8 ha core area, 93 ha
   woodlot area). Red-eyed Vireo productivity was particularly low, with
   single-brooded females unable to maintain populations in any woodlots
   monitored, although populations were close to replacement levels in
   continuous forest. Only the very largest fragments acted as sources for
   Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus) and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina)
   (i.e., >23 ha in core area, 225 ha in total woodlot area). Ovenbird and
   Wood Thrush were the most area-sensitive, and Rose-breasted Grosbeak
   (Pheucticus ludovicianus) and Veery (Catharus fuscens) the least,
   although all four species had significantly lower reproductive success
   in small as compared to large forest fragments. Reproductive success of
   Rose-breasted Grosbeaks and Veery were similar in large forest fragments
   and continuous forest and were close to maintenance levels in small
   fragments, despite published reports of significant declines that might
   be attributable to poor productivity. Nest predation was the major cause
   of nest failure, with brood parasitism by Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) further reducing the number of host young fledged from
   Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo nests. Parasitism rates on the remaining
   species were very low and not analyzed statistically. Local forest cover
   had little effect on predation rate or rate of parasitism by
   Brown-headed Cowbirds. Although local forest cover had little effect on
   reproductive success within fragmented landscapes, nest success was
   significantly higher in continuous forest than in all fragments combined
   for both Ovenbird and Red-eyed Vireo. Our data show a poor agreement
   with Breeding Bird Survey population trend estimates for Ontario between
   1986 and 1996. As only 1\% of the forest fragments locally available are
   large enough to function as source habitats, we strongly advocate their
   preservation. We recommend preservation of forest tracts at least 500 ha
   in size, particularly woodlots with >90 ha in core area, to function as
   sources that will help guard against population declines on a local
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{On request of the Dutch government a committee of the Health Council of
   the Netherlands has reviewed the role that results of field research in
   its broadest sense (i.e., including multi-species toxicity tests in the
   laboratory, research on model ecosystems et cetera) can play in
   ecotoxicological risk assessment for the authorisation of pesticides.
   The Committee believes that field research can provide valuable
   additional data about the exposure of non-target organisms and the
   resultant effects at population, community and ecosystem level. However,
   it frequently is unclear how these data might be used in reaching a
   decision about authorisation. To solve this problem, it is necessary to
   specify what is understood by ``unacceptable damage{''}. Both more
   clearly formulated protection goals of the government and a better
   understanding of the ecological significance of effects are needed to
   clarify this. Furthermore, the Committee points out that the statistical
   power of field trials must be sufficient to allow for the detection of
   changes that might be regarded as ecologically relevant. Finally, it
   recommends keeping a finger on the pulse in relation to authorised
   pesticides by monitoring their presence in environmental compartments
   and by investigating their role in suddenly occurring mortality among
   conspicuous animal species, such as birds, fish and honeybees. This kind
   of research forms a safety net for substances that have been wrongly
   authorised.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to study the effect of winter low
   temperatures on survival, reproduction, and growth of immature stages,
   and the host fruit infestation ability of the Mediterranean fruit fly,
   Ceratitis Capitata (Wiedemann), wild population in the southernmost part
   of Greece. Adult flies were monitored using Jackson and McPhail traps
   from November to May over a period of 3 yr. In January-March, absolute
   minimum and maximum air temperatures were 1-4.5 and 19-26 degreesC,
   respectively, whereas the average monthly minima and maxima were 6.2-9.7
   degreesC and 15.4-18.5 degreesC, respectively. Adults were found at
   every inspection period (every second week) in at least one of the
   trapping systems used or the years of the study. Until the beginning of
   April developed eggs and sperm were found in >70\% of females trapped.
   From mid-April until mid-May, 20-70\% of females were fecund and
   fertile. This increased at the end of May- beginning of June to high
   percentages, >80\%. Females survived in cages in the field an average of
   4 mo in winter-spring, with some females surviving 5-6 mo. Infested
   `Navel', `Valencia' oranges, or bitter oranges could be found throughout
   the experimental period in all 3 yr and live eggs were always detected
   in infested fruits. Grown larvae were found in relatively high
   percentages of infested fruits until March, especially in bitter
   oranges, which appear to be a preferred host (up to 25 pupae per
   infested fruit). In April-May, grown larvae were seldom detected. In
   winter, larval development from the time of fruit sampling until larval
   exit often took 1.5-2 mo. The duration of the pupal stage under field
   temperatures was approximate to 2 mo for those pupae formed between
   December and February. This was reduced progressively to 10-20 d for
   those pupae formed in May. The mortality of young larvae (still near the
   oviposition hole) was between 40 and 70\% from November until May,
   whereas adult emergence from pupae kept in the field fluctuated between
   20 and 80\%. In conclusion, under the conditions of southern Greece
   (Heraklion, Crete) the Mediterranean fruit fly continues reproduction
   and growth during the cooler part of the year but at reduced rates and
   with longer duration of larval and pupal stages. This must be considered
   in control or eradication applications.}},

Abstract = {{The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), attacks a wide range of
   legumes including many important forage and vegetable crops. Although
   economic injury levels for pea aphids are seldom exceeded in forage
   crops, aphid densities can reach extremely high levels during a single
   harvest cycle. After harvest of forage crops, large numbers of pea
   aphids may disperse into proximate vegetable fields. The objective of
   this study was to determine the potential impact of immigrating pea
   aphids on vegetable crops adjoining forage crops in the agricultural
   landscape pea aphids collected from alfalfa and clover were evaluated
   for their ability to survive on and their propensity to feed on
   vegetable crops. The survival of pea aphids collected from clover and
   alfalfa was significantly higher on these forage crops than on peas,
   green beans and lima beans in laboratory transplant experiments. In
   additional laboratory experiments, alfalfa-adapted aphids produced
   significantly fewer aphid offspring on lima beans than on alfalfa, and
   the adults and offspring had significantly higher mortality on lima bean
   leaves than on alfalfa leaves. Analysis of aphid feeding with an
   electronic monitor confirmed that alfalfa-adapted pea aphids feed on
   phloem sap from alfalfa but never feed on lima beans. These results led
   us to predict that pea aphids immigrating from alfalfa and other forage
   crops during harvest would not establish persistent, damage-causing
   populations in nearby vegetable crops. Our field data on pea aphid
   populations in lima beans were consistent with this hypothesis. High
   densities of pea aphids were found in lima beans immediately after
   harvests of nearly alfalfa fields, but high aphid densities did not
   persist >3 d. Our study, suggests that although aphids can emigrate from
   forage crops to vegetable crops at densities above published action
   thresholds, the amount of damage actually caused by these forage-crop
   adapted aphids in higher-value vegetable crops will be minimal. It may
   be unnecessary to treat aphids in lima beans and other vegetables when
   aphids have immigrated from harvested forage crops. These findings
   suggest that pest management decision-making in vegetables can be
   improved by considering the source of immigrating pests such as pea
   aphids.}},

Abstract = {{To clarify the relationship between overwintering and spring migration
   in the bollworm Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) in Israel, we caged larvae
   under field conditions in fall and used sex pheromone traps to monitor
   field populations the following spring. No diapause was detected in
   October-exposed individuals. Overall, 67.7 and 89.2\% of the individuals
   exposed to field conditions during November and December, respectively
   entered pupal diapause. Most nondiapausing individuals eclosed early in
   the following January. In contrast, postdiapause adults started to
   eclose synchronously in late April. Approximately 50\% of the
   postdiapaused females eclosed before 6 May. 9 d before 50\% of the males
   did. Capture of field H. armigera moths in sex pheromone traps occurred
   1 mo before the eclosion of adults from caged overwintering diapause
   pupae. Moths trapped before the eclosion of diapausing individuals had
   lower. wing loading, fewer wing scales, and larger relative thorax size
   (ratio of thorax to head widths). These morphometric data imply. that
   the early. season field moths were trapped after long distance flight.
   Taken together the phenological and morphometrical data support the
   notion that H. armigera exhibits an early -spring migratory behavior in
   Israel. These results are discussed within the context of physiological
   and genetic data from related studies.}},

Abstract = {{Federal land managers in the western United States are interested in the
   potential of prescribed fire as a tool to decrease fuel loads, increase
   vegetational heterogeneity, and increase faunal diversity in various
   ecosystems. I tested whether implementation of a prescribed fire program
   by the US Forest Service in a watershed in the central Great Basin had
   significant effects on butterfly species richness and composition. I
   monitored butterfly communities during the first two years after
   implementation in five to seven burn units and controls in the
   watershed. To estimate baseline spatial and temporal variation in
   butterfly communities in the greater ecosystem, I also monitored
   butterflies in five untreated canyons outside the project area.
   Butterfly species richness and butterfly species composition (measured
   as community similarity) did not differ significantly between burn units
   and controls. Geographic location had statistically significant effects
   on species richness. Butterfly species composition of individual
   locations varied over time, as did the magnitude of that variation.
   These results emphasize that standardized, repeatable monitoring
   protocols are vital for evaluating the effects of experimental
   management treatments and for predicting and assessing the effects of
   future management strategies and environmental changes.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a field experiment to determine the direct and indirect
   effects of spraying two broad-spectrum insecticides with widely
   differing avian toxicities in grassland habitat on the survival and
   reproductive success of nesting songbirds. Three 56-ha plots were
   sprayed with Decis 5F (TM), three plots were sprayed with Furadan 480F
   (TM), and three plots were left unsprayed. Insecticides were applied at
   rates recommended for grasshopper control. Grasshopper (Orthoptera:
   Acrididae) density was measured throughout the spring and summer. Nests
   of chestnut-collared longspurs (Calcarius ornatus) were monitored to
   determine survival rates and nestling growth. Food habits of nestlings
   and parental foraging parameters were measured using esophageal
   ligatures and observations of parental foraging flights. Applications of
   both insecticides decreased grasshopper populations by more than 90\%.
   Nevertheless, the number of grasshoppers in nestling diets was
   significantly decreased only in nests in Decis-sprayed plots. Total
   arthropod biomass delivered to the nestlings did not decrease in plots
   sprayed with either insecticide. Nestling weight and size were
   unaffected by insecticide spraying. Rate of prey delivery also did not
   change; however, by two weeks after spraying with Decis, parent
   longspurs were foraging almost twice as far from their nests as were
   birds in control plots (p < 0.05) to maintain prey delivery rates.
   Clutch size and egg and nestling success were similar among treated and
   control plots within specific two-week periods during the season.
   Age-corrected brain acetylcholinesterase activities of longspur
   nestlings in plots Sprayed with Furadan were significantly depressed
   compared to controls; a single case of insecticide-induced mortality was
   detected in a nestling that was severely infested with blowfly larvae.
   Nevertheless, success of nests with Furadan-exposed nestlings (n = 20)
   was greater than that in control plots during the two-week period
   following spray (n = 19, p = 0.03); The Baird's sparrow (Ammodramus
   bairdii), an uncommon prairie species of conservation concern, was
   monitored using an index of productivity. The number of 3.14-ha census
   circles having productive Baird's sparrow territories was significantly
   lower in Furadan-sprayed plots than in unsprayed and Decis-sprayed
   plots; a larger number of sparrow territories were abandoned in Furadan
   plots.}},

Abstract = {{We review various aspects of the structure and functioning of Danish
   estuaries from data collected by the National Monitoring Program and
   from information in published sources. We present data on the physical,
   chemical, and biological characteristics of estuaries in Denmark, we
   evaluate the functioning of these systems as filters and transformers of
   nutrients, and we evaluate the outlook for Danish estuaries in the
   future. Danish estuarine systems are for the most part shallow (< 3 m
   deep), have short residence times, and tend to be heavily loaded with
   nutrients primarily from agricultural sources. Total average loads from
   land per unit watershed area are 112 kg P km (2) yr(-1) and 2,400 kg N
   km(-2) yr(-1) during the period 1989-1995. The total phosphorus (TP)
   load in estuaries has been significantly reduced over the last decade,
   following implementation of the 1987 Action Plan for the Aquatic
   Environment (Vandmiljoplan in Danish) that prescribed that nitrogen
   loads to the total aquatic environment should be reduced by 50\% and
   phosphorus loads by 80\%. Reductions in the total nitrogen (TN) load
   have been more modest. Nutrient loading is one of the primary
   determinants of estuarine nutrient concentration with 70\% of the annual
   variation in TN concentration and 55\% of the annual variation in TP
   concentration explained by variation in the load. Many Danish estuaries
   have rich communities of macrophytes and benthic filter feeders, such as
   Mytlis edulis and Ciona intestinalis, that can control water column
   chlorophyll concentrations by their filter feeding activities. Many of
   the estuaries experience hypoxia and anoxia, especially during warm and
   calm summer months. Further reductions in nutrient loading are expected
   following implementation of the Action Plan for the Aquatic Environment
   II, with predicted improvements in oxygen concentrations and in the
   functioning of these shallow, dynamic estuarine systems.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial behaviour of fishes in fresh and brackish water ranges in
   temporal scales between localized diel movements, often associated with
   foraging and predator evasion, to seasonal or life-cycle related events
   involving movements between freshwater habitats or freshwater and marine
   biotopes. Recent technological advances have resulted in dramatic
   improvements in the range of techniques available for the study of
   spatial behaviour of freshwater fishes in the natural environment, and
   broadly may be divided into two categories: capture dependent and
   capture independent. The former incorporates those methods that rely on
   sampling marked fish (mark recapture) or unmarked fish (density
   estimates, catch per unit effort) over defined scales of time and space
   in order to derive information on distribution and movement. Captured
   fish may also be tagged with transmitters that radiate energy, enabling
   the fish to be tracked and/or environmental data to be gathered.
   Biochemical analysis of samples from fish, requiring non-destructive
   sampling (genetic analysis and scale microchemistry) or destructive
   sampling (otolith microchemistry) may also provide information on
   migration and ontogenetic processes. Capture independent techniques
   include visual observation and video techniques, hydroacoustics and
   automated fish counting. Catch per unit effort and mark recapture
   techniques are most efficient where long-term fishery or monitoring
   studies are in place and data on crude spatial and temporal scales are
   acceptable. They also have the advantages of low technical requirements
   and low equipment costs. Where specific management or ecological
   questions are pertinent, recapture independent techniques may be more
   appropriate. Telemetric methods can provide high resolution information
   at the individual level, while hydroacoustics is increasingly providing
   information at the population level in large lake and river

Title = {{Trade-offs in phenotypic traits: endurance at birth, growth, survival,
   predation and susceptibility to parasitism in a lizard, Lacerta vivipara}},

Abstract = {{1. Considerable within-population variability of locomotor performance
   traits has been shown to exist in several species of squamate reptiles.
   In general, high values for speed and endurance are thought to have
   positive effects on the ability to capture prey, escape from predators,
   compete with conspecifics and acquire mates. On the other hand,
   variation in performance might trade-off with other components of
   fitness such that the net effect on Darwinian fitness is unpredictable.
   2. Gravid females of the common lizard (Lacerta vivipara) were captured
   and several phenotypic traits of their offspring measured immediately
   following birth. These were endurance, body length and body mass.
   Offspring were marked for individual identification, released into the
   field, and correlations between the phenotypic traits and their
   subsequent growth, activity and survival rate over the next months were
   then tested for. Parasitism by hematozoa was monitored and predation
   risk by tail losses estimated.
   3. It was found that individuals with a low endurance at birth tended to
   have reduced activity and growth rate, and higher parasite load; on the
   positive side, however, they experienced lower predation risk as
   assessed by tail losses. Conversely, individuals with a high endurance
   at birth had high activity and growth rates, low parasite load, but
   higher incidence of broken tails. Finally, endurance at birth was not
   correlated with survivorship up to the age of sexual maturity. Thus,
   individuals with varying locomotor endurance seem to exhibit behaviours
   that may result in the same level of Darwinian fitness.
   4. The possibility that our results reveal a trade-off between the risk
   of becoming infected with parasites when lizards are less active (which
   is related to having lower endurance) vs the risk of being predated when
   the lizards are more active (higher endurance) is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The reindeer-herding Southern Saamis, from Central Norway. were the
   population group exposed to the highest levels of radioactivity in
   Norway, following the Chernobyl accident. Radiocesium whole-body
   contents and dietary habits have been investigated regularly in this
   population group since 1987, Meat of semi-domesticated reindeer is
   important in their diet, and earlier studies have shown that
   contaminated reindeer meat contributes about 90\% to the total intake of
   radiocesium. A major part of the group also consumes mild food products
   like game, freshwater fish, mushrooms, and berries. The application of
   countermeasures has been a common practice for the reindeer herders
   since the Chernobyl accident, According to the interviews in 1996, the
   three most commonly used and socially accepted countermeasures were (1)
   selection of reindeer for consumption after live monitoring of
   radiocesium concentrations; (2) selection of reindeer for consumption
   from less contaminated grazing areas; and (3) clean feeding of animals
   before slaughtering. Despite these countermeasures about one third of
   the population still have reduced reindeer meat intake because of the
   Chernobyl fallout, In 1996. the average whole body concentration of
   Cs-137 for this population was found to be 88+/-7 By kg(-1) for women
   and 164+/-11 Bq kg(-1) for men (arithmetic mean +/- standard error),
   This is approximately half of the whole-body concentration of Cs-137
   measured in the same population in 1990-1991.}},

Abstract = {{Pollen dispersal and gene flow in the grass meadow fescue (Festuca
   pratensis Huds.) were studied using two populations which were
   homozygous for different allozymes at the Gpi-2 locus. The populations
   were established in a concentric donor-acceptor field experiment. Gene
   flow was found mainly to be affected by the distance between the donor
   and acceptor plants. Analysing 21 132 acceptor plant progenies, gene
   flow was shown to decrease rapidly with distance to the donor field up
   to 75 m, and beyond this distance much more slowly. The ability of donor
   pollen to fertilize acceptor plants depended very much on the density of
   the acceptor plants. Pairs of acceptor plants produced more compatible
   pollen locally, and captured significantly less donor pollen than
   single-plants. Despite the higher seed production of acceptor plants
   planted in pairs, the absolute number of heterozygous seeds carrying the
   donor allele was always lower than for single-plants, Wind direction had
   only a slight effect upon the type of pollen captured. Because of pollen
   production within the two plant populations being continuous and
   overlapping, the time when anthesis occurred had little effect on gene
   flow between the populations. Vigorous and tall acceptor plants with
   many panicles, high seed yield and high 1000-seed weight were able to
   capture more donor pollen than shorter plants. The results may be used
   to assess the risk of gene flow and to develop strategies for monitoring
   the spread of transgenes from genetically modified grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative genetic studies of life-history traits in wild populations
   are very rare, yet variance/ covariance estimates of these traits are
   crucial to understanding the evolution of reproductive strategies. We
   estimated heritabilities (h(2)) of several life-history traits
   (longevity, age and mass at primiparity, and reproductive traits) in two
   bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) populations, and both phenotypic (r(p))
   and genetic (r(A)) correlations between life-history traits in one
   population. We included adult mass in our analyses because it is related
   to several life-history traits. We used the mother-daughter regression
   method and resampling tests based on data from long-term monitoring of
   marked females. Contrary to the theoretical prediction of low
   heritability for fitness-related traits, heritability estimates in the
   Ram Mountain population ranged from 0.02 to 0.81 (mean of 0.52), and
   several were different from zero. Coefficients of variation tend to
   support the hypothesis of a higher environmental influence on
   life-history traits. In contrast, at Sheep River we found low
   heritabilities of life-history traits. Phenotypic correlations Varied
   between -0.09 and 0.95. Several genetic correlations were strong,
   particularly for different reproductive traits that are functionally
   related, and ranged from -0.34 to 1.71. Overall, genetic and phenotypic
   correlations between the same variables were similar in magnitude and
   direction. We found no phenotypic or genetic correlations suggesting
   trade-offs among life-history traits. Bighorn sheep may not form the
   large, outbred populations at equilibrium that are assumed by both
   Fisher's fundamental theorem and by theories predicting antagonistic
   pleiotropy between life-history traits. Alternatively, the absence of
   negative genetic correlations may result from genetic variation in
   ability to acquire resources or from novel environmental conditions
   existing during the study period.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the mayfly Cloeon dipterum from 48 ponds (3000 l
   fibre-glass tanks of 1 m depth) were monitored over the course of 1
   year. To simulate possible patterns of climatic change, the ponds were
   subject to three temperature treatments: continuous heating to 3
   degreesC above ambient; heating to 3 degreesC above ambient during the
   summer only; and no heating. Further experimental complexity included
   enhanced nutrient input into the ponds and the presence or absence of
   fish, giving a factorial combination of 3 temperature regimes x 2
   nutrient levels x presence/absence of fish predation.
   Few nymphs were found in the presence of fish. Where fish were absent,
   the temperature treatments did not significantly affect nymph
   abundances, and only marginally influenced mean nymph body-lengths. In
   contrast, the nutrient treatment had significant effects on both nymph
   abundance and size, with greater numbers of generally larger nymphs
   occurring in those fish-free ponds receiving additional nutrients. Adult
   emergence began earlier in the year from the heated ponds, particularly
   those ponds receiving additional nutrients. Adult body-length differed
   between temperature treatments, but consistent patterns were difficult
   to ascertain because of interactions with nutrient treatment and
   seasonal effects.
   Our results show that during the short term at least, elevated
   temperature as a simulation of climate change does not have an
   overwhelming influence on either mayfly abundance or size. The influence
   of temperature is subtle and subject to complex interaction with other
   habitat variables. We therefore suggest that the direct consequences of
   small changes in temperature will likely be of little significance to C.

Title = {{The effects of fragmentation on fluctuating asymmetry in passerine birds

Abstract = {{1. Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) refers to the difference between the right
   and left sides in characters that should otherwise be bilaterally
   symmetrical, but whose expression is affected by epigenetic stress
   during development. Forest fragmentation may promote an increase in FA
   in isolated populations, by either genetic or environmental stress. FA
   may function as a biomonitor index in conservation biology if increased
   levels were observed in populations from fragmented habitats.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that FA is higher in birds from small
   tropical forest patches than in large forest tracts. We measured wing
   and tarsus FA on mist-netted birds from seven fragments and seven
   continuous areas from south-eastern Atlantic rain forest in Brazil. We
   performed FA comparisons between fragments and control groups for the
   whole community, for individual foraging guilds and for the six most
   abundant species.
   3. Wing and tarsus FA were significantly greater in fragments than
   continuous areas for the whole community and were both negatively
   correlated with forest fragment size. Differences in FA varied among
   foraging guilds, being more evident for insectivorous species,
   especially those feeding in or near the understorey.
   4. FA levels increased significantly in forest fragments in at least one
   trait for five of the six most abundant species. There was no
   correlation between tarsus and wing asymmetries for the individuals of
   any species nor any difference between the degree of asymmetries of
   these characters.
   5. We suggest that FA is a useful tool to assess the effects of
   fragmentation on forest birds, and may be applied in monitoring
   neotropical birds, FA indices might be profitably developed,
   particularly in species most threatened by fragmentation effects and
   when investigated in different morphological characters.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted to determine the utility of overseeding endophyte
   enhanced varieties of perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., into
   existing stands of Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., to manage
   bluegrass billbug, Sphenophorus parvulus Gyllenhal, larval populations
   and their damage. Two commercial varieties of endophyte enhanced
   perennial ryegrass (Repell II and Triple Play) were overseeded at two
   different rates in the field. S, parvulus larval populations, their
   damage, and turfgrass composition were monitored over the course of 3
   yr. Significantly fewer larvae were found in plots overseeded with
   Repell II, whereas Triple Play had no significant effect on larval
   population density. Endophyte infection was confirmed in approximate to
   58\% of all Repell ii shoots, where as only approximate to 31\% of
   Triple Play shoots were infected. Regression analysis, using a segmented
   model, demonstrated that larval populations declined as the proportion
   of endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass increased. However, no
   additional reductions in larval population density were achieved in
   stands containing >40\% endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass. Visual
   damage varied with cultivar, seeding rate, and year, but generally
   decreased as the proportion of endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass
   increased. Although seeding rate had ten initial effect on turfgrass
   composition, these differences were not detected after the first year of
   the study. Results indicate overseeding existing stands of Kentucky
   bluegrass with endophytic varieties of perennial ryegrass can reduce S,
   parvulus larval populations and their damage. However, plant genetic
   characteristics (i.e., different cultivars) may be overriding
   determinants of many aspects of plant performance including
   establishment tolerance to insect feeding, and expression of
   endophyte-mediated resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Eucalyptus spp. plantations represent >60\% of the reforested area in
   Brazil. Although ambrosia beetle attacks on live trees were at first
   nonexistent, they have begun to appear with greater frequency.
   Monitoring for pest insects is a key factor in integrated pest
   management, and baited traps are one of the most widely used methods for
   insect population detection and survey. We compared the efficiency of
   the most widely used trap in Brazil to survey for ambrosia beetles and
   other Scolytidae, the ESALQ-84 type, with other traditionally employed
   traps: the multiple funnel (Lindgren trap); drainpipe; and slot
   (Theyson) traps, in a Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden stand in Brazil.
   The ESALQ-84 trap was the most efficient in trapping Hypothenemus
   eruditus Westwood and Hypothenemus obscurus (F.); the multiple funnel
   trap caught significantly more Cryptocarenus diadematus Eggers; whereas
   the slot trap caught more Premnobius cavipennis Eichhoff and Xyleborus
   affinis Eichhoff than the other traps. The drainpipe trap was the least
   effective trap overall. When corrected for number of beetles caught per
   trap surface area, catches were significantly higher on the ESALQ-84
   trap for the majority of the species analyzed, probably because of a
   smaller trap surface area. The slot trap was recommended for it caught
   overall more beetles of the three most economically important scolytid
   species in eucalypt plantations in Brazil, P. cavipennis, X. affinis,
   and X, ferrugineus.}},

Abstract = {{Field populations of Hypothenemus hampei (Ferrari), Plutella xylostella
   (L.), Spodoptera exigua (Hubner), Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and Bemisia
   tabaci (Gennadius) were tested for resistance to several insecticides
   commonly used in Nicaragua. Assays were conducted to estimate the
   LD(50)s or LC(50)s and the corresponding resistance ratios. A diagnostic
   concentration was used to discriminate between susceptible and resistant
   strains of H. hampei. The tests with >6,000 a hampei adults collected
   from six different sites indicate the absence of resistance to
   endosulfan. Resistance to cypermethrin, deltamethrin, chlorfluazuron,
   thiocyclam, and methamidophos was documented in six field populations of
   P, xylostella. High levels of resistance to cypermethrin and
   deltamethrin, but moderate levels of resistance to chlorpyriphos and
   methomyl, were also documented in two field populations of S, exigua.
   Moderate levels of resistance to cypermethrin, deltamethrin and
   chlorpyriphos were also documented in three field populations of H. tea.
   Moderate to high levels of resistance to bifenthrin, methamidophos and
   endosulfan were documented in four field populations of B. tabaci. The
   presence of significant correlations between LD(50)s or LC(50)s suggests
   the occurrence of cross-resistance or simultaneous selection for
   resistance by different insecticides with different modes of action. Our
   data could not differentiate between these two possibilities. Because
   insecticides will continue being used in Nicaragua, a resistance
   management program is urgently needed. The implementation of integrated
   pest management tactics must be accompanied by specific regulations for
   pesticide registration. In the future, pesticide registration
   regulations in Nicaragua should include periodic resistance monitoring.
   The mechanisms to cover the costs of resistance monitoring and
   resistance management should also be established.}},

Abstract = {{The organophosphorus insecticide, azamethiphos, is widely used
   throughout the world to control the housefly, Musca domestica (L.).
   Since its commercial introduction to Denmark in 1983 for this purpose,
   we have monitored the toxicity of azamethiphos to housefly populations
   at livestock farms throughout the country and carried out regular field
   studies. The findings of our field studies, which have revealed a strong
   potential for resistance development, have been born out by regular
   surveys showing that resistance has increased in recent years. Through
   the analysis of a field derived laboratory strain, we have implicated
   oxidative and hydrolytic mechanisms together with altered
   acetylcholinesterase in this resistance. Our field and laboratory
   studies have also indicated that resistance is relatively unstable, and
   can revert in the absence of selection. The implications of our findings
   for the continued efficacy of azamethiphos are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted at two hem mills where male Indian meal moths,
   Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), were captured using pheromone-baited
   traps. Objectives were to determine the distribution of male P.
   interpunctella at different locations in and around the mills throughout
   the season, and to monitor moth activity before and after one of the
   mills was fumigated with methyl bromide to assess efficacy of treatment.
   Commercially available sticky traps baited with the P. interpunctella
   sex pheromone were placed at various locations outside and within the
   larger of the two mills (mill I). Moths were captured inside mill 1
   after methyl bromide fumigations. The highest numbers of P.
   interpunctella were caught outside the facility and at ground floor
   locations near outside openings. Additional traps placed in the rooms
   above the concrete stored-wheat silos at mill 1 during the second year
   captured more moths than did traps within the mill's production and
   warehouse areas. In another study, moths were trapped at various
   distances hem a smaller flour mill (mill 2) to determine the
   distribution of moths outdoors relative to the mill. There was a
   negative correlation between moth capture and distance from the
   facility, which suggested that moth activity was concentrated at or near
   the flour mill. The effectiveness of the methyl bromide fumigations in
   suppressing moth populations could not be assessed with certainty
   because moths captured after fumigation may have immigrated from outside
   through opened lending bay warehouse doors. This study documents high
   levels of P. interpunctella outdoors relative to those recorded inside a
   food processing facility. Potential for immigration of P. interpunctella
   into flour mills and other stored product facilities from other sources
   may be greater than previously recognized. Moth entry into a food
   processing facility after fumigation is a problem that should be
   addressed by pest managers.}},

Pages = {{1-15}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Use of coastal beaches by nonbreeding shorebirds along the Pacific coast
   of North America is poorly understood because survey efforts have
   targeted large bays and wetlands where birds concentrate. Consequently;
   we studied coastal shorebird distributions and community composition by
   conducting monthly surveys at 40, 0.5-km linear plots along sandy
   beaches of coastal northern California from January through April 1996.
   We recorded 12 species, whose ranked abundances were consistent between
   winter (January-February) and spring (March-April). However, five of the
   six commonest species were more abundant in winter than spring. Among
   beaches, we detected a mean of 2.6 +/- 2.3 (SD; range: 0-9) species and
   12.0 +/- 14.1 (range: 0-62) individuals. Number of species correlated
   positively with total shorebird abundance. Most species abundances
   varied greatly among sites; nine taxa had aggregated spatial
   distributions, one species was hyper-dispersed, and two species were
   randomly distributed among beaches. Species composition of the shorebird
   community was highly nested, partly because abundant species were more
   widespread in their occurrence than less-numerous taxa. More species and
   individuals occurred at sites near Humboldt Bay; probably because high
   tides forced birds off their principal feeding areas within the bay to
   adjacent beaches. Variation in shorebird use of beaches suggests that
   some areas are more important to wintering and migrating shorebirds than
   other locations. Although current levels of human activity in coastal
   northern California do not appear to influence distributions of
   nonbreeding shorebirds, we suggest that monitoring and management plans
   be considered to minimize potential negative impacts of recreational
   activities, which are certain to increase with human population size and
   recreational use of beaches.}},

Abstract = {{Terrestrial salamanders are increasingly being used in long-term
   amphibian monitoring programs. Issues concerning the validity and
   repeatability of most relative abundance indices derived from
   terrestrial salamander studies are poorly resolved, however. We examined
   the feasibility of using area-constrained searches of natural cover
   objects for monitoring terrestrial salamanders by comparing
   repeatability and power for a monitoring design that uses yearly site
   averages versus single annual searches of individual plots. We also
   examined the validity of using surface searches as measures of
   population decline by comparing mean surface catch on 15 plots with a
   mark-recapture estimate of absolute population size. We conducted annual
   searches of 54 plots at 18 sites in eastern Tennessee and western North
   Carolina for 2-3 years. Repeatability was moderate to high for both site
   and individual plot values (mean r(2) = 0.59-0.96 for different
   taxonomic groupings), and average repeatability for individual plots was
   only slightly lower than repeatability based on site averages for three
   searches per year. For a given annual sampling effort, greater power is
   achieved by conducting a single annual search of plots rather than
   repeated seasonal searches (three plots per site) at fewer sites.
   Surface catch was strongly correlated with the estimate of absolute
   population size (r(2) = 0.66-0.84; P < 0.003) for the two numerically
   dominant groups (P. jordani and the D. ochrophaeus complex) and for all
   salamanders pooled. These relationships suggest that area-constrained
   searches of natural cover objects generate valid indices for use in
   monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was conducted to determine population changes and niche
   Variation in the soil at two depths (0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm) of
   Paratrichodorus minor and Belonolaimus longicaudatus populations
   following fumigation. Eight plots each of potato (Solanum tuberosum) and
   cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata), fumigated with 1,
   3-dichloropropene or nonfumigated, were established. Eight plots of
   sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (Sorghum bicolor x S. arundinaceum var.
   sudanense) were also used to monitor depth distribution (0 to 20 cm and
   20 to 40 cm) of B. longicaudatus and P. minor following each
   cabbage/potato season. Soil samples were taken 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40
   cm deep during the potato/cabbage, and sorghum-sudangrass growing
   seasons. During the 1993-94 and 1994-95 potato/cabbage seasons, P, minor
   was found at highest numbers at 20 to 40 cm, whereas numbers of B.
   longicaudatus were highest at 0 to 20 cm. During the 1994 and 1995
   sorghum-sudangrass growing seasons, B. longicaudatus numbers were
   highest at 0 to 20 cm. Paratrichodorus minor numbers were highest at 0
   to 20 cm and at 20 to 40 cm deep in the 1994 and 1995 sorghum-sudangrass
   growing seasons, respectively. Reduction by soil fumigation of B,
   longicaudatus at 0 to 20 cm deep did not affect depth distribution or
   cause P. mine, populations to increase in potato or cabbage plots.
   Paratrichodorus minor numbers increased at 20 to 40 cm deep in the
   1994-95 cabbage season after soil fumigation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of soybean maturity and determinacy on the host-parasite
   relationships of Heterodera glycines were investigated in a field
   microplot study over 2 years. Determinate and indeterminate isolines on
   the maturity group (MG) III cultivar Williams 82 and the MG V cultivar
   Essex were grown in microplots artificially infested with a race 3
   isolate of H. glycines at three initial population (Pi) densities (0,
   300, and 3,000 eggs/100 cm(3) soil). Soybean seed yields, nematode final
   population (Pf) densities and reproductive index (Pf/Pi), and root
   colonization by Macrophomina phaseolina, the causal agent of charcoal
   rots, were monitored in each year. Seed yields were reduced (P less than
   or equal to 0.05) in the presence of H. glycines in both years, but
   losses were greater in 1996 in the absence of drought stress. Yield loss
   was lower (P less than or equal to 0.06) for the determinate isoline of
   Essex than for the other cultivar-isoline treatments across years.
   Nematode reproduction was density-dependent in the more conductive
   environment of 1996 but was unaffected by soybean maturity of
   determinacy traits. Root colonization by M. phaseolina increased (P less
   than or equal to 0.05) in the presence of high H. glycines densities on
   determinate, but not indeterminate, isolines. Differences in H.
   glycines-induced yield loss among cultivar-isoline treatments were not
   related to nematode reproduction, M. phaseolina colonization, or
   environmental stresses. These results indicate that the effects of
   soybean maturity and determinacy of H. glycines-soybean interactions are
   not independent and that their combined effects must be considered in
   geographic regions where both traits vary.}},

   or July depending on the orchard and year. Numbers of females per gram
   of root increased once or twice each year. The maximum density of eggs
   per gram of root was recorded in April at Xalamera and Carcer orchards,
   but there was no recognizable peak in the other two orchards. Numbers of
   nematodes in soil, females or eggs program of root, of eggs per female
   were correlated with either temperature or rainfall in the sampling
   month, 1 month before sampling, or in the second preceding month,
   depending on the orchard. Members of the Pasteuria group were present in
   the four citrus orchards, and a positive relationship occurred between
   nematodes in soil and bacterial parasitism (r(2) = 0.75) in the orchard

Abstract = {{Little is known about the dynamics and the ecological interactions among
   ramets: (fronds) from populations of clonal red seaweeds. Small ramets
   are very difficult to tag, so their growth cannot be monitored directly,
   The temporal variation of the relationship between stand biomass and
   ramet density offers information on ramet performance. We calculated
   this relationship for an intertidal population of Pterocladiella
   capillacea (Gmelin) Santelices et Hommersand (Gelidiales) from Baja
   California, Mexico. Biomass and density were positively correlated on an
   annual basis, indicating that biomass accumulated without involving
   self-thinning among ramets, This contrasts with nonclonal seaweeds, for
   which self-thinning among individuals occurs during growth, but agrees
   with other clonal red seaweeds, such as Chondrus crispus Stackhouse and
   Mazzaella cornucopiae (Postels ef Ruprecht) Hommersand (both
   Gigartinales), The growth pattern for these members of the Gelidiales
   and of the Gigartinales holds despite differences in holdfast morphology
   and ramet branching degree and despite differences in the capacity of
   coalescence during early stages, known only for the Gigartinales, The
   positive slope for the dynamic biomass-density relationship, on a
   bilogarithmic scale, was statistically steeper for M, cornucopiae than
   For P. capillacea and for C, crispus. This suggests that the addition of
   new ramets during the growth season may be relatively more beneficial
   for biomass accumulation rates for M, cornucopiae, This would be
   expected for high-intertidal species subjected to strong abiotic stress,
   for which ramet crowding constitutes a key protection, Pterocladiella
   capillacea occurs at the mid-intertidal zone and C, crispus at the
   subtidal zone, so ramets would be relatively less important in that
   respect.}},

Abstract = {{Recently the exotic cladoceran Daphnia lumholtzi has invaded freshwater
   systems throughout the southern and midwestern United States. We
   conducted regional surveys of eastern Kansas reservoirs to document the
   range expansion of D.lumholtzi. Daphnia lumholtzi was found in five of
   35 reservoirs sampled in 1994, and 11 of the 35 reservoirs when
   re-sampled in 1997. In addition, we sampled 40 small ponds inaccessible
   to recreational boats, within the watershed of an invaded reservoir. We
   did not find D.lumholtzi in any of these ponds, suggesting that
   non-human dispersal mechanisms play an insignificant role in the range
   expansion of D.lumholtzi throughout the United States. Further
   experimentation, however, is needed to determine if the absence of
   D.lumholtzi from these small ponds is due to insufficient dispersal
   mechanisms or the inability of this invader to successfully colonize
   following arrival. Daphnia lumholtzi has broad limnological tolerances.
   However, invaded reservoirs tend to be larger in area, have higher
   Secchi disk depths, and lower total phosphorus, total nitrogen and
   chlorophyll a levels relative to non-invaded reservoirs. Analyses of
   pre-invasion zooplankton communities indicate that D.lumholtzi may be
   invading reservoirs in which native Daphnia species are rare. While the
   long-term effects of the invasion of D.lumholtzi are unknown, it has the
   potential to dominate late summer zooplankton communities in eastern
   Kansas reservoirs. Therefore, we need to continue to survey and monitor
   invaded reservoirs to document the range expansion of D.lumholtzi and
   determine the long-term implications of the introduction of this
   invader.}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal dynamics of metazooplankton biomass was monitored in an
   aerated waste stabilization pond during three consecutive years
   (1994-1996). The pond showed a low diversity of planktonic metazoans
   because of elevated pH, relatively high concentration of free dissolved
   ammonia and low oxygen concentration. The planktonic community was
   composed of the anomopod branchiopod Daphnia magna, and the cyclopoid
   copepods Cyclops vicinus and Cyclops strenuus. Both predation by
   cyclopoids and competition with D.magna excluded rotifers from the pond,
   except during a short period in spring 1996. Daphnia magna was the
   dominant organism from a biomass point of view. In parallel with
   biomass, demographic parameters, secondary production and the spatial
   distribution of D.magna were studied. A significant seasonal and
   interannual Variation in the density, biomass and production of D.magna
   was observed. The maximum density of daphnids varied from 264 x 10(3) to
   686 x 10(3) individuals m(-2) and the maximum biomass from 4 to 30 g dry
   weight (DW) m(-2). The annual net production was high compared with the
   production of Daphnia in natural environments, ranging from 288 to 593 g
   DW m(-2) year(-1). The annual net production of exuviae accounted for
   similar to 25\% of the total annual net production. Harvesting of
   daphnids for commercial applications that took place during the
   productive period did not have any discernible effect on the population
   dynamics of D.magna. Sexual reproduction was not observed during the
   three studied years. Negative mortality rates, occurring during early
   spring, however, indicated that recruitment from ephippia was effective
   in the pond of Differdange and that sexual reproduction took place
   before 1994. Swarming was regularly observed in relation to high
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{From 1995 to 1999, shell disease in lobsters, Homarus americanus, was
   monitored in research trawl and trap surveys conducted in Rhode Island
   waters including Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island and Block Island Sound,
   and the offshore areas of Block and Hudson Canyons. In the inshore
   population a significant increase in frequency and severity of the
   disease was documented beginning in 1996, reaching 20\% infected by 1999
   with over 50\% of ovigerous females affected. Shell disease was noted in
   the offshore lobster population bt ginning in 1998. A tag-recapture
   study conducted in Narragansett Bay between 1997 and 1999 followed the
   change in severity over a 3-year period in the field for 86 individuals.
   Observed disease pathways point to potential affects for reproductive
   behavior and mortality. The proportion infected with disease appealed to
   diminish over the molting period, but subsequently increased in
   infection rate and shell coverage during the months of September and
   October.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing use of molecular genetic techniques in ecology and
   evolution, it has become apparent that methods of non-destructive DNA
   sampling must be developed. In this study we collected 50 blue mussels
   (Mytilus spp.) in each of three size categories: small (10-20 mm),
   medium (20-30 mm), and large (30+ mm). Hemolymph was extracted from 25
   mussels in each size category and the remaining 25 mussels served as
   controls. The hemolymph was extracted and control mussels were monitored
   for 384 days, during which Lime no significant differences in survival
   or growth were found. We extracted DNA from the hemolymph and
   successfully polymerase chain reaction-amplified the TTS and Glu-5'
   species-specific markers from 81\% and 92\% of the samples.
   respectively, and determined that all mussels were Mytilus trossulus
   (Lamarck). The extraction of hemolymph for DNA analysis allows for
   molecular investigations of populations ur species which are either rare
   or in limited numbers, and for life history investigations where
   survival of the organism is necessary.}},

Abstract = {{The dinoflagellate Prorocentrum lima (Ehrenberg) Dodge was found at
   several sites along the coast of Maine in 1998 and 1999, some in areas
   where shellfish are harvested commercially. Identity was confirmed by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Although this dinoflagellate is
   known to produce toxins (okadaic acid and derivative compounds),
   incidence of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning in coastal Maine is not well
   understood, despite confirmed toxicity events in the early 1990s in Nova
   Scotia, Canada in adjoining waters to the north. Some samples containing
   the dinoflagellate came from wild mussel populations collected at low
   tide, while others originated from aquaculture sites. Many of the cells
   were isolated from water samples and net rows and on a few occasions
   were associated with filamentous macroalgae. Prorocentrum lima appears
   to be relatively rare in Maine coastal waters, but its widespread
   distribution over several months warrants increased monitoring to allay
   public health concerns.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and seasonal distribution of Culex mosquitoes were
   monitored by measuring oviposition activity during the summers of 1995,
   1996, and 1997. Five species of culicine mosquitoes laid egg rafts in
   ovitraps. Egg rafts of 4 Culex species-Cx. restuans (54.98\%), Cx.
   pipiens (25.41\%), Cx. salinarius (12.18\%), and Cx. tarsalis
   (0.14\%)-constituted more than 92\% of the total egg rafts collected.
   Culiseta inornata (0.1\%) was the only other species to lay viable egg
   rafts in the ovitraps. A small percentage (7.19\%) of egg rafts did not
   hatch; thus identification was not possible. Compared with New Jersey
   light trap data in a nearby area, the abundance of Cx. tarsalis and Cs.
   inornata was markedly underestimated with ovitraps. These data may also
   reflect differences in the specific location of the 2 trap sites rather
   than attractiveness of ovitraps for Cx. tarsalis and Cs. inornata. In
   general, Cx. restuans oviposition activity began in late May, and it was
   the dominant Culex species through June. After July 1, the number of egg
   rafts laid by Cx. restuans decreased continually until the end of the
   summer. Culex pipiens and Cx. salinarius oviposition began in early June
   and increased gradually during the summer. Over the course of a summer,
   there were about twice as many Cx. pipiens as there were Cx. salinarius.
   A crossover in the number of Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans egg rafts
   occurred in late July or early August, depending on the year. By late
   August each year, Cx. pipiens was the most abundant species. At this
   time, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius populations were similar, but each
   was about half of the Cx. pipiens population Differences in the
   abundance of all 3 species could not be explained by changes in ambient
   temperature (both minimum and maximum) or relative humidity, either
   within or among years.}},

   P-glucuronidase, a-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-beta -glucosaminidase were
   measured. Three- to five-day-old females of both strains were fed on
   infected and uninfected clawed jirds (Meriones unguiculatus) then
   dissected or homogenized at 2 h, at 24-h intervals for 5 days, and at 8
   and 10 days after treatment. Enzyme activities were assayed by a
   fluorometric procedure. The susceptible strain maintained an 80\%
   infection and 18.6 larvae/mosquito over the 10-day period. In contrast,
   the refractory strain was initially 33\% infected and had a mean of 4.9
   larvae/mosquito and this decreased to 20\% by 3 days, and to 3\% with a
   mean of 0.33 larvae/mosquito at 10 days. Significantly higher acid
   phosphatase and P-glucuronidase activities were observed in the
   refractory strain at specific time intervals after infection, alpha
   -Glucosidase and N-acetyl-beta -glucosaminidase were highly variable
   among strains and according to infection status. Analysis of the results
   of this study suggests that certain acid hydrolase enzymes could be
   involved in the elimination of B. pahangi in refractory strains of Ae.
   aegypti and could be used to monitor biochemical changes in response to
   filarial nematode infections in certain mosquito populations.}},

Abstract = {{Density and size of Chromis fumea (Pisces: Pomacentridae) were regularly
   monitored during 13 months (from August 1996 to August 1997), on two
   artificial reefs in New Caledonia (south-west Pacific ocean): a
   ship-wreck (CT2) just after scuttling, and an assemblage of iron boxes
   (Caissons) sunk more than 50 years ago. The settlement of C. fumea was
   first observed 20 August 1996 and lasted 20 days. At the beginning the
   recruits were 1 cm size-class fish and at the end 2 cm size-class. This
   major settlement phase was again observed one year later (September
   1997). A second minor settlement phase occurred in December 1996 on CT2.
   Significant immigration of adults was also observed between November
   1996 (6 cm) and April 1997 (7 cm), indicating that this species is
   capable of medium range migration (>50 m). Population size decreased by
   87.8\% between the settlement of juveniles and the first immigration
   phase of adults. The final density of the 1996 cohort was 10.5\% of the
   initial input of recruits on CT2 and 19.3\% on Caissons. Initial density
   of recruits was 3.4 times higher on CT2 than on Caissons, whereas
   density of juveniles was similar at the end of the survey, indicating
   that post-settlement mortality was greater on CT2. Chromis fumea von
   Bertalanffy growth models were similar on CT2 and Caissons. This
   short-lived species is characterized by an initial rapid growth phase (K
   > 3.36 y(-1)), with the fish reaching 68.5\% of L-infinity in three
   months, and a second slower growth phase (1 cm in ten months).}},

Abstract = {{One of the most discussed environmental effects associated with the use
   of transgenic plants is the flow of genes to plants in the environment.
   The flow of genes may occur through pollen since it is the reproductive
   system that is designed for gene movement. Pollen-mediated gene escape
   is hard to control in mating plants. Pollen from a wind pollinator can
   move over distances of more than 1000 m. To investigate the efficiency
   of transgenic pollen movement under realistic environmental conditions,
   the use of bait plants might be an effective tool. In this study,
   cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) sugar beets were tested with regard to
   their potential for monitoring transgene now. As the pollen source,
   transgenic sugar beets were used that express recombinant DNA encoding
   viral (beet necrotic yellow vein virus) resistance, and antibiotic
   (kanamycin) and herbicide (glufosinate) tolerance genes. In a field
   trial, the effectiveness of a hemp (Cannabis sativa) stripe containment
   strategy was tested by measuring the frequency of pollinated CMS bait
   plants placed at different distances and directions from a transgenic
   pollen source. The results demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the
   containment strategy. Physiological and molecular tests confirmed the
   escape and production of transgenic offspring more than 200 m behind the
   hemp containment. Since absolute containment is unlikely to be
   effective, the CMS-bait plant detection system is a useful tool for
   other monitoring: purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Lepidopterans are considered an important group of Eucalyptus pests in
   Brazil due to severe losses in wood production arising from defoliation.
   Biweekly collections were made in the State of Goias, Brazil as part of
   a study of the population dynamics and the effects of temperature and
   rainfall on Lepidoptera pests of Eucalyptus. Lepidoptera were collected
   with five light traps installed at two meters high with black light and
   powered by a 12 volt battery. These insects were divided into groups
   according to their importance as pests of Eucalyptus: group 1: 11
   primary pests; group 2: 10 secondary pests; group 3: 64 species without
   defined importance to Eucalyptus; and group 4: non-identified species.
   Among the primary pests, Thyrinteina arnobia (Geometridae), Eupseudosoma
   aberrans (Arctiidae) and Sarsina violascens (Lymantriidae) were the most
   frequent, the last two being constant (> 50\% of collections) and the
   first one accessory (25-50\%). Idalus admirabilis (Arctiidae) and Eacles
   imperialis magnifica (Saturniidae) were the most frequent secondary
   pests, the first being constant and the second accessory. Most of the
   Lepidoptera species were collected during the coldest and driest months,
   which indicates that these conditions could favour the occurrence of
   Lepidoptera outbreaks in plantations of Eucalyptus in this region of
   Brazil. For this reason, population monitoring of these species should
   be intensified during these periods.}},

Abstract = {{Annual counts of nests with eggs or chicks (known nests) were made at
   blue penguin (Eudyptula minor) breeding sites on the Otago Peninsula in
   each November from 1994 to 1997. Although the population has doubled to
   an estimated 600 known nests over this period, the number of breeding
   sites on the Otago Peninsula has reduced since the 1970s. Breeding
   success at three areas at Taiaroa Head were monitored by regular nest
   checks in the breeding season from 1992 to 1998. At Taiaroa Head
   reproductive success ranged from 41 to 78\% at the three sites during
   the seven-year study and was generally higher for pairs nesting in nest
   boxes than for those in burrows. The percentage of breeding pairs that
   laid a second clutch after fledging at least one chick from their first
   clutch (double brooded) varied between seasons (0-48\%) and was
   correlated with the date of the onset of breeding. Egg loss, possibly
   through predation by Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus), influenced the
   significantly lower reproductive success at one area (Area A) at Taiaroa
   Head during the 1996 season.}},

Abstract = {{A comparative ecological study of closely related invasive and
   non-invasive species, Senecio madagascariensis and S. lauttus
   (Asteraceae), investigated what traits might confer invasive ability in
   very similar species. Life-history attributes of the weed S.
   madagascariensis were compared to five habitat-specific subspecies of S.
   lautus: S. l. alpinus, S, l. dissectifolius, S. l. lanceolatus and two
   forms of S. l. maritimus. Field populations of each taxon were monitored
   to compare their population ecology. Relative rates of phenological
   development were compared at a single location. Seed germination was
   studied in a laboratory experiment. Transplant experiments were
   conducted in a range of S. madagascariensis and S. lautus habitats to
   compare performance in different environments. In monitored field
   populations S. madagascariensis produced seedlings and reproductive
   cohorts more frequently, flowered for longer periods, produced more
   seeds and had fewer germinable achenes in the soil compared to S. lautus
   taxa, S. madagascariensis achenes had higher rates of germination than
   S. lautus in both light and dark conditions. S. madagascariensis was
   found to have higher rates of survival than S. lautus taxa in 3 range of
   habitats and to be faster to flower in both transplant and standard
   glasshouse environments. Overall S. madagascariensis performed better
   than S. lautus ecotypes in terms of seedling, growth and fecundity
   measurements and second best For achenes. Despite relatively good
   performance in terms of life-history traits there is no evidence that S.
   madagascariensis is invading S. lautus habitats. We speculate that
   physiological and morphological adaptations to specialised environments
   are a better explanation for success of Senecio taxa/ecotypes than
   generalised life-history trait performance. We suggest that invasiveness
   is essentially unpredictable, due to habitat/plant specific interactions
   between invader and area of introduction. In the absence of predictive
   theory, quarantine authorities should use a combination of methods to
   assess invasive potential including a database of known weeds,
   performance comparisons between congeneric natives and exotics in a
   range of habitats at proposed point of introduction and monitoring of
   introduced species to determine if they spread.}},

Abstract = {{After outbreaks of potato brown rot in three different fields in the
   Netherlands, the fate of the brown rot pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum
   biovar 2, was monitored in soil by immunofluorescence colony staining
   (IFC) supported by R. solanacearum division-2 specific polymerase chain
   reaction. In selected areas of all fields, the R. solanacearum
   population densities were initially on the order 10(4) to 10(6) per g of
   topsoil. These population densities then declined progressively over
   time. In two fields, however, the pathogen persisted for periods of 10
   to 12 months. The survival of a selected R. solanancearum biovar 2
   isolate, strain 1609, in three soils, a loamy sand and two different
   silt loam soils, was further studied in soil microcosm experiments. The
   effects of temperature and soil moisture content were assessed. At 12 or
   15 and 20 degreesC, a gradual decline of the population densities was
   observed in all three soils, from the established 10(5) to 10(6) CFU
   g(-1) of dry soil to significantly reduced levels, occasionally
   bordering the limit of detection (10(2) CFU g(-1) of dry soil), in
   periods of approximately 90 to 210 days. Soil type affected the rate of
   population decline at 20 degreesC, with the greatest decline occurring
   in loamy sand soil. In all three soils, the survival of IFC-detectable
   R. solanacearum 1609 cells at 4 degreesC was severely impaired,
   reflected in an accelerated decline of CFU counts, to undetectable
   numbers. Moreover, indications were found for the occurrence of viable
   but nonculturable strain 1609 cells in the loamy sand as well as in one
   silt loam soil under these conditions. In addition, a single
   freezing-thawing cycle caused a significant additional reduction of the
   culturable R. solanacearum 1609 populations in the three soils, though
   detectable populations remained. Moderate soil moisture fluctuations of
   approximately pF 2 did not affect the survival of R. solanacearumm 1609
   in soil. Severe drought, however, drastically reduced the populations of
   strain 1609 CFU in all three soils.}},

Abstract = {{Greasy spot, caused by Mycosphaerella citri, causes defoliation and
   yield losses on grapefruit in all areas of Florida, but is more severe
   in southwest Florida and the east coast than in central Florida. The
   amount of leaf litter, numbers of ascospores produced, and severity of
   greasy spot on trap plants were monitored throughout 1997 and 1998 in
   Immokalee (southwest Florida) and Lake Alfred (central Florida). Leaf
   litter and ascospore production were greatest from March to July in both
   locations, with little litter and few ascospores thereafter. Ascospore
   production occurred earlier in Immokalee than in Lake Alfred in both
   years. Disease on trap plants was moderate to severe throughout the year
   except from November to February. Large numbers of ascospores produced
   early in the year when conditions were less favorable resulted in the
   same disease severity levels as low numbers of ascospores produced later
   in the year when environmental conditions were favorable. Greater greasy
   spot severity in southwest Florida, compared with central Florida, is
   more likely due to higher rainfall and warmer winter temperatures than
   to differences in time of infection. Single annual copper fungicide
   applications were made each month from April to August in 1998 and 1999
   in LaBelle (southwest Florida), Ft. Pierce least coast), and Lake Alfred
   to determine the most effective time of application. Two two-spray
   treatments, May + July and June + August, were also evaluated in 1999. A
   single copper fungicide application in June provided the most
   consistently effective control across all locations. The June + August
   two-spray treatment was very effective in disease control, but usually
   no better than a well-timed single application.}},

Abstract = {{Isolates of Puccinia triticina were obtained from wheat leaf collections
   made by cooperators throughout the United States and from surveys of
   wheat fields and nurseries in the Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and Gulf
   Coast states in 1996, 1997, and 1998. Virulence-avirulence phenotypes
   were determined on 14 host lines that are near-isogenic for leaf rust
   resistance. We found 31 phenotypes among 277 single uredinial isolates
   in 1996, 56 phenotypes among 989 isolates in 1997, and 43 phenotypes
   among 989 isolates in 1998. As in previous surveys, regional race
   distribution patterns showed that the central United States is a single
   epidemiological unit distinct from the eastern United States. The
   distinctive racial composition of collections from the southeast,
   northeast, and Ohio Valley indicate that populations of P. triticina in
   those areas are not closely connected, suggesting that epidemics
   originate from localized overwintering sources.}},

Abstract = {{Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) once were ubiquitous in large areas,
   including lands now contained in the national parks of the Intermountain
   and Colorado Plateau regions of the United States. Due to catastrophic
   declines in the late 1800s and early 1900s, most extant populations now
   occur as small, isolated groups with a highly fragmented distribution.
   Three different subspecies of bighorn, sheep were extirpated from 14 of
   18 areas that are now managed by the National Park Service. We describe
   an eight-year plan to restore bighorn sheep to currently suitable
   historic habitats in the national parks within a six-state intermountain
   region of the western United States, 1991-1998. A seven-point program
   was recommended for each park unit that included: (1) survey the
   existing populations; (2) conduct a GIS-based habitat assessment to
   identify suitable habitat; (3) convene scientific advisory panels to
   review results of habitat assessment; (4) convene interagency panels to
   discuss metapopulation management and to plan the restoration(s); (5)
   draft interagency restoration and management plans; (6) conduct
   translocation(s); and (7) monitor the populations. We evaluated 38,781
   km(2) of area; 32\% (12,329 km(2)) was potential habitat for bighorn
   sheep. The scientific advisory panels and the GIS modeling recommended
   bighorn restoration on 73 sites within these areas. By 1996, 36 of these
   sites (2,647 km(2) or 22\% of the entire suitable area) were inhabited
   by bighorn sheep. By 1999, the translocated animals increased 25\%, and
   restoration efforts will continue in many of the remaining sites.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is proceeding in
   several western states. Measurement of nutritional resources (quality
   and quantity) is not normally conducted to assess future and present
   translocation sites, although it has been recommended generally for
   evaluation of ungulate habitat. We estimated nutritional carrying
   capacity (based on nitrogen in forage species) of three mountain ranges
   in Trans-Pecos Texas where desert bighorn sheep have been translocated.
   We used an explicit nutritional constraint model to estimate carrying
   capacity on a seasonal basis. Although drought conditions prevailed
   during the study period, bighorns were not limited by quantity of
   vegetation. However, forage biomass of high nutritional quality (>1.5\%
   N) was very low (<9 kg/ha in spring; <1 kg/ha in all other seasons).
   Consequently, there appeared to be inadequate forage of high N content
   for bighorns to meet reproductive requirements in some seasons.
   Estimates generated using the explicit nutritional constraint carrying
   capacity model appeared to be realistic relative to observed densities.
   Nutritional sampling and modeling can predict potential carrying
   capacity on areas scheduled for restoration or on ranges already
   stocked, predict effects of management on carrying capacity, and allow
   managers to compare among restoration sites. We recommend that desert
   bighorn managers focus on monitoring the abundance of high-quality (\%N)
   forage species, especially during periods of drought or higher
   nutritional requirements (e.g., lactation, post-weanling growth).}},

Abstract = {{The single greatest obstacle to the restoration of large, healthy,
   populations of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) in the western United
   States is epizootic outbreaks of bronchopneumonia that may kill 20-100\%
   of the animals in populations. Although the species is capable of rapid
   initial growth rates following restoration into new habitat (lambda =
   1.23-1.30 have been observed), these rates of increase are typical only
   a few years following the release of a population, and then most
   populations either decline to extirpation or remnant status (<30
   animals) or remain at <100 individuals. We studied the fecundity and
   survivorship of three increasing, and three declining and suspected
   diseased, populations of bighorn sheep (the latter were subjected to
   outbreaks of bronchopneumonia) located in or near several large national
   parks in the western United States from 1991 to 1996. Titers verified
   both population categories were exposed to the bacteria Pasteurella
   haemolytica serotypes 3; 4; and 3, 4, 10; Moraxella sp., and
   parainfluenza-3 and bluetongue (BT) viruses. Pregnancy rates of adult
   ewes were not different in increasing or decreasing populations (pooled
   rate = 0.93; p = 0.57), but pregnancy rates of yearlings were lower
   (0.00 for decreasing vs. 0.33 for increasing populations), initial
   production of lambs and annual recruitment of lambs was lower (0.14,
   decreasing vs. 0.66, p < 0.05). Adult survival was lower during: the
   first year of an epizootic, 0.62, in one population, but recovered to
   0.85 by the second and subsequent years. Survival of adult rams was
   variable in diseased populations; in two populations rams appeared to be
   disproportionately impacted, but in a third population rams survived
   better during the epizootic. In all the increasing park (unhunted)
   populations, adult ram survival (0.94 +/- 0.01) was higher than adult
   ewe survival (0.89 +/- 0.02) (p = 0.10), in contrast to published
   information from hunted populations where ram survival was lower.
   Removal of about 20\% of one population for restorations severely
   impacted one declining population. Removals of 12-20\% appeared to be
   excessive and were not readily compensated for in the Canyonlands
   National Park desert bighorn population. Disease was a significant
   limiting factor to restoration of bighorn sheep in the study areas; six
   of 11 total recovering populations we monitored closely were negatively
   influenced by apparent disease at some time during our observations.}},

Abstract = {{reproductive success of barn swallows (Hirundo rustical was monitored at
   two colonies near Commerce, Texas, during 1998. At the north colony,
   25\% of nests were depredated by the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis
   invicta). None of the nests at the south colony were depredated by fire
   ants despite the fact that density of fire ant mounds was more than
   three times greater than at the north colony. Differences in depredation
   rates among colonies may be due to attributes of the nesting sites and
   nesting dispersion of the swallows which limit the impact of red
   imported fire ants. An evaluation of barn swallow populations in Texas
   counties before and after invasion by red imported fire ants suggests
   that these ants have had no effect on long-term populations trends in
   barn swallows.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored breeding activities of endangered least terns (Sterna
   antillarum athalassos) to determine effects of hydropower and
   flood-control operations of Keystone Dam on the 94 km of the Arkansas
   River from Tulsa to Muskogee, Oklahoma. Our objectives were to determine
   numbers and productivity of least terns and flow management needs to
   reduce losses of nests and chicks from flooding and enhance nesting
   habitat. After breeding colonies of least terns were located, nest
   locations were mapped from 19 May to 26 August 1992 and 14 May to 30
   August 1993. Both years had periodic high flows on the Arkansas River.
   Unlike 1992, bank-full flows in May 1993 reached a discharge of >140,000
   cfs (cubic feet per second) through Keystone Dam before least terns
   initiated nesting. Flows in 1993 scoured and elevated existing sandbars
   and created new sandbars, resulting in an expansion of nesting habitat
   that was associated with an increase from 12 breeding colonies in 1992
   to 20 colonies in 1993. Estimates of adult least terns increased from
   125-166 breeding pairs in 1992 to 212-299 in 1993. Least terns produced
   192 nests, 118 chicks, and 80 fledglings in 1992 compared with 345
   nests, 285 chicks, and 143 fledglings in 1993. Loss of nests to flooding
   was greater in 1992 (46\% of 77 nests lost) than 1993 (9\% of 133 nests
   lost). Overall loss of chicks was greater in 1993 (50\% than 1992
   (32\%). Benefit to nesting habitats by periodic high flows before the
   nesting period was exemplified by a larger population of least terns and
   fewer losses of nests and chicks to flooding in 1993 than 1992 along the
   Arkansas River below Keystone Dam.}},

Abstract = {{Simple genetic algorithms have been used to solve many water resources
   problems, but specifying the parameters that control how adaptive search
   is performed can be a difficult and time-consuming trial-and-error
   process. However, theoretical relationships for population sizing and
   timescale analysis have been developed that can provide pragmatic tools
   for vastly limiting the number of parameter combinations that must be
   considered. The purpose of this technical note is to summarize these
   relationships for the water resources community and to illustrate their
   practical utility in a long-term groundwater monitoring design
   application. These relationships, which model the effects of the primary
   operators of a simple generic algorithm (selection, recombination, and
   mutation), provide a highly efficient method for ensuring convergence to
   near-optimal or optimal solutions. Application of the method to a
   monitoring design test case identified robust parameter values using
   only three trial runs.}},

Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Calling surveys are used to monitor trends in frog populations for most
   North American species. However, wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), one of the
   most abundant species in New England, may not be detectable using
   calling surveys at breeding ponds. We assessed the efficacy of using
   egg-mass counts to monitor wood frog populations in southern Rhode
   Island from 1997 to 1999. We completely encircled 8 breeding ponds with
   drift-fence arrays to quantify adult wood frog population size and then
   censused egg masses. Egg-mass counts were highly correlated with number
   of females (r=0.97, P<0.001) and males (r=0.95, P<0.001) and accounted
   for approximately 92\% of females captured by drift-fence arrays. Counts
   of egg masses at the same breeding ponds by 2 observers varied by 12\%.
   Based on studies of egg-deposition chronology, breeding ponds should be
   surveyed over a 3-week period to ensure that all egg masses are
   censused. in smaller breeding ponds with <100 egg masses, 16\% of egg
   masses may be deposited at sites away from the communal aggregation.
   Therefore, the entire breeding pond should be searched to ensure that
   all egg masses are counted. Egg-mass surveys are more cost-effective
   than drift-fence arrays and provide more information than calling
   surveys. We suggest that egg-mass counts may be an effective means to
   monitor wood frog populations, as it is a relatively accurate and
   precise survey technique.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective was to identify seasonal and annual survival rates, in the
   context of habitat and other environmental conditions, necessary to
   identify ultimate causes of proximate mortality for white-tailed deer
   (Odocoileus virginianus) in the central Black Hills. From 1993 to 1996,
   we monitored radiocollared female (n=73) white-tailed deer in the
   central Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. Natural mortality
   (i.e., from coyotes {[}Canus latrans], dogs, malnutrition, sickness, and
   unknown causes) (n=44, 71\%) was the primary cause of female mortality,
   followed by harvest (n=14, 22.6\%) and accidental causes (i.e., road
   kill and drowning) (n=4, 6.5\%). More females died in spring (n=33,
   53.2\%) than in fall (n=14, 22.6\%), winter (n=9, 14.5\%), or summer
   (n=6, 9.7\%). For the entire study period (1993-1996), survival rate for
   female white-tailed deer was 10.4\%. Annual survival rates of females
   ranged from 50.3 to 62.1\% and were similar among years (P=0.743).
   Intraseasonal survival rates for females differed between winter
   (P=0.003) and spring (P=0.014), whereas summer (P=0.073) and fall
   (P=0.404) were similar. High spring mortality of females was related to
   poor forage conditions on winter range and limited escape cover
   throughout the central Black Hills. We recommend the use of management
   techniques that promote overstory and understory plant diversity, such
   as aspen (Populus tremuloides) regeneration and prescribed burns, to
   improve the habitat in this region.}},

Abstract = {{We synthesize the results of empirical studies of marine reserves to
   assess the potential benefits of protection for fish populations. Our
   meta-analyses demonstrate that the overall abundance of fishes inside
   reserves is, on average, 3.7 times higher than outside reserve
   boundaries. This enhancement is mainly a result of a significant
   increase in abundance of species that are the target of fisheries.
   Non-target species are equally abundant inside and outside reserves.
   Large-bodied species also respond more to protection, irrespective of
   their fishery status. Species within genera show great heterogeneity in
   their response to protection despite similarities in their life
   histories. Our study confirms that marine reserves benefit fish
   populations and highlights the need for monitoring prior to reserve
   establishment to provide more accurate, habitat-controlled studies of
   the effects of marine reserves on fish populations.}},

Abstract = {{During the period of plankton development (April to October 1996), the
   trophic relationships among phytoplankton, metazooplankton,
   protozooplankton and bacterioplankton were quantitatively studied at one
   location in the Belgian part of the river Meuse. Biomass fluctuations of
   phytoplankton, metazooplankton, bacteria and protozoa were monitored
   fortnightly. On the basis of in situ measurements of the fluxes of
   primary production, metazooplankton grazing, organic matter consumption
   by bacteria and grazing of bacteria by protozoa, the carbon fluxes
   between the different compartments of the first trophic levels were
   estimated on eleven sampling dates. Net primary production was measured
   from incubations with C-14 bicarbonate and grazing of algae by
   metazooplankton was determined by in situ incubations with labelled
   algae in a grazing chamber. The algal biomass ingested was corrected for
   the edible phytoplankton and the carbon assimilated by metazooplankton
   was calculated taking into account zooplankton assimilation yield
   estimated from experimental data and from literature values. Bacterial
   production was evaluated by H-3-thymidine and H-3-leucine incorporation
   rates, and bacterial carbon demand was calculated taking into account a
   growth yield of 30\%. Measurements of mortality and grazing of bacteria
   showed that grazing by protozooplankton was the major loss process
   indicating the main role of this compartment in the control of bacterial
   biomass. In the studied stretch of the river Meuse, autochthonous
   production exceeded, in most situations, the allochthonous inputs to the
   river. On average over the studied period, carbon consumption by
   metazooplankton and bacteria balanced organic carbon inputs from primary
   production and external loading. The large part of primary production
   used by bacteria and indirectly by protozooplankton points to the
   potential importance of the microbial food web in this river system.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Abstract = {{We reviewed 180 case studies and a number of theoretical papers on
   animal relocations published in 12 major international scientific
   journals over the last 20 years. The study focused on re-introductions,
   supplementations and translocations (sensu IUCN, 1996. IUCN/SSC
   Guidelines for Re-introductions. 41st Meeting of the IUCN Council,
   Gland, Switzerland, May 1995.
   Http://iucn.org/themes/ssc/pubs/policy/hinte.htm.). We did not assess
   introductions. Re-introductions were the most common type of relocation
   (116/180); three quarters of these were conducted For conservation
   purposes. Supplementations (48/180) and translocations (36/180) occurred
   less frequently, and both were commonly carried out for reasons other
   than conservation. Simple descriptive statistics were used to analyse
   factors influencing relocation success. Translocations that aimed to
   solve human-animal conflicts generally failed. Re-introduction success
   was not found to have changed over the last two decades, but
   re-introductions appeared to be more successful when the source
   population was wild, a large number of animals was released (n > 100),
   and the cause of original decline was removed. More complex trends were
   found for the effect of predation and the use of supportive measures
   such as provision of food or shelter, or predator control prior to
   release. The success of 47\% of re-introductions was uncertain at the
   time case studies were published in journals. This was partly due to the
   lack of generally accepted and widely applied criteria to assess
   success. Very few case studies (3\%) reported the cost of the relocation
   attempt. We conclude that there were three primary aims for animal
   relocations. These were to solve human-animal conflicts, to restock game
   populations, and conservation. Our extensive review of the present
   literature leads us to conclude that the value of animal relocations as
   a conservation tool could be enhanced through (1) more rigorous testing
   for the appropriateness of the approach in a given case, (2) the
   establishment of widely used and generally accepted criteria for judging
   the success or failure of relocations, (3) better monitoring after a
   relocation, (4) better financial accountability, and (5) greater effort
   to publish the results of relocations, even ones that are unsuccessful.

Abstract = {{Set-aside is a potentially important habitat for field voles, (Microtus
   agrestis), populations of which may have declined in lowland Britain. We
   hypothesized that field vole abundance would increase with the length of
   time set-aside was left in situ. To test this we monitored development
   of field vole populations in the first 2 years after set-aside
   establishment, and on older set-aside we related abundance to set-aside
   age and vegetative characteristics. Voles were not recorded on set-aside
   until 9 months after establishment, and populations only began to
   increase after nearly 2 years. In set-aside fields 2-9 years old, vole
   abundances were not related to age, but increased with the proportion of
   grasses and litter in the sward. Management practices such as sowing
   with a grass seed mix, mowing at least once annually and leaving
   set-aside in place for >2 years are likely to benefit held voles. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite its potential importance as a source of fitness variation in
   natural plant populations, few studies have so far examined long-term
   patterns of individual differences in progeny viability under natural
   conditions. This paper reports on a six-year field study on the
   differences in progeny viability (defined here as the probability of
   seeds contributing an established, prereproductive juvenile to the
   population), and its two components (seedling emergence and seedling
   survivorship), for the Mediterranean evergreen shrub Lavandula
   latifolia. The main objectives of the study were (1) to assess whether
   individual plants actually differ in the viability of their progeny
   under natural conditions, and (2) to determine if naturally occurring
   levels of variation in viability may modify individual differences in
   fecundity. Seed progenies from 14 maternal parents belonging to one
   population were sown at 10 held sites differing broadly in habitat type
   and soil characteristics, and seedling emergence and survival
   subsequently were monitored for six years. Maternal parents differed
   significantly in progeny viability because of both differential seedling
   emergence and seedling survivorship, and variation in either of these
   parameters was not significantly related to maternal differences in seed
   size. Differences in seedling survivorship were more important than
   differences in seedling emergence as determinants of maternal variation
   in progeny viability.While individual differences in seedling emergence
   remained consistent across sowing sites, there was a strong parent x
   sowing site interaction on seedling survivorship, and the rank of
   maternal parents with regard to this Variable varied erratically among
   sowing sites. A significant inverse relationship existed across maternal
   parents between seed production and progeny viability, which was not
   mediated by differences in seed size, thus suggesting a trade-off
   between the number and quality of the progeny produced by L. latifolia
   plants. Although maternal differences in seed production were about
   twice as important as differences in progeny viability in determining
   maternal differences in juvenile recruitment, viability differences
   should not be disregarded a priori as unimportant sources of fitness
   differences. Results of this study stress the importance of conducting
   long-term, direct field assessments of individual differences in progeny
   viability across a range of environments encompassing the conditions
   actually faced by the species.}},

Abstract = {{An in situ bioassay using mouthpart deformities in Chironomus riparius
   larvae was developed to monitor sediment toxicity, Second-instar larvae,
   along with a standardized amount of food and sediment taken from the
   study locations, were enclosed in cages that were placed on the sediment
   surface of rivers, Mouthpart deformities were screened after larval
   molting to the fourth instar (exposure time: 7-10 days). Mouthpart
   deformities of caged and field larvae (when present) were related to the
   estimated sediment toxicity, By summing toxicant concentrations and
   normalizing them to the organic matter and clay contents, a significant
   relationship between toxicity levels and mouthpart deformities in the
   mentum was revealed. Results suggest that the pattern of observed
   deformities was indicative of site toxicity rather than a characteristic
   of the laboratory larval population used. The main advantage of the
   proposed in situ bioassay is the possibility to assess the incidence of
   deformities at sites where C, riparius does not occur naturally. (C).

Abstract = {{Many VOC represent hazards to human health through chronic exposure.
   Recent European and world-wide legislation proposes limit values for
   ambient concentrations of these compounds. However, very little
   experimental data exists for true population exposure. In 1996, the
   European MACBETH initiative set out to measure population exposure to
   benzene in six European cities. This study details the French
   contribution to this program. Six campaigns were carried out, each
   comprising measurements at 100 outdoor sites and the participation of 50
   non-smoking volunteers who wore personal samplers and had passive
   monitors installed in their homes. Iso-concentration maps were drawn for
   each campaign and the results showed that outdoor concentrations were
   significantly lower than indoors. Almost 75\% of the volunteers were
   exposed to mean concentrations higher than the limit value of 5 mu
   gm(-3). It is demonstrated that personal exposure levels cannot be
   deduced simply by combining indoor and outdoor background
   concentrations. It is also shown that there is need for better knowledge
   of the contributions to overall exposure of outdoor microenvironments
   and the authors hope that future European directives will take this into
   account.}},

   receiving heightened interest as the adverse health effects of chronic
   exposure to certain of these compounds are identified. Active (pumped)

Abstract = {{Norwich is the eastern most city in the United Kingdom. Despite a
   population of only 100,000 and very little local industry, studies have
   shown that the city experiences levels of nitrogen dioxide, ozone,
   particulates and sulphur dioxide exceeding the UK Air Quality Standards.
   Because of Norwich's situation within a large, predominantly rural area
   a large non-resident workforce is one factor that contributes to large,
   often very congested traffic flows. The city's location close to the
   European mainland also exposes it to polluted airmasses transported from
   the continent, especially in the case of particulates and ozone. In
   order to assess the relative contributions of local and regional
   sources, data from rural and urban monitoring sites are to be used in
   conjunction with ADMS-Urban and the UK Meteorological Office's NAME
   model.}},

Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{Eyespot pathogens, Tapesia yallundae and Tapesia acuformis, were
   isolated from two trial sites in the UK over several years. Both sites
   were treated with 2 applications per year of cyprodinil (a new
   anilinopyrimidine fungicide), prochloraz and a mixture of cyprodinil
   with prochloraz. One trial site was exposed to cyprodinil for 3 years,
   and the second for a total of 11 years, including 5 years before the
   trial was initiated. Control of eyespot and sensitivity to cyprodinil
   were monitored. During the first 3 years of the trial, disease control
   with all fungicide treatments ranged from 43\% to 82\%. At the site,
   where the trial was extended for a further 3 years, control then began
   to decline but no practical resistance was detected. The decline in
   control by both fungicides suggests that factors other than reduced
   sensitivity might be involved. Field isolates of both T. yallundae and
   T. acuformis with reduced sensitivity to cyprodinil were found
   predominantly in plots treated with cyprodinil. A reduction in
   sensitivity to cyprodinil was identified in the population from
   cyprodinil-treated plots in two years out of six, and in the population
   from mixture plots in the final year. No obvious trends could be
   identified and in-vivo studies showed control of most isolates with
   reduced sensitivity could be regained by increasing the dose to one
   tenth of the recommended field rate. Analysis of progeny from sexual
   crosses involving a sensitive isolate and a field isolate with an ED,,
   value higher than the baseline sensitivity range indicated that a single
   gene controlled the reduction in sensitivity to cyprodinil in one T.
   yallundae isolate. There is clearly a resistance risk in eyespot to
   cyprodinil. The reduction in sensitivity is monogenic in inheritance and
   at a significant level in some isolates, but any shift in sensitivity in
   field populations has so far been gradual.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite remote sensing data and methods can be used to develop maps of
   large areas at different times in order to assess changes in forest
   ecosystem patterns and processes. Such maps are useful in understanding
   wildlife populations and habitat, forest biodiversity, and forest
   productivity. They may be important in ecological monitoring programs at
   multiple spatial and temporal scales, and could include assessment of
   structural aspects of the landscape, such as forest or habitat
   fragmentation. Quantification and measurement of landscape structure
   depend on the definition of landscape classes or patches, defined on the
   basis of more or less homogeneous elements, which differ in some
   measurable way from neighbouring patches. In this paper, we review some
   of the issues, and provide examples using satellite remote sensing data,
   in the quantification of landscape structure in two Canadian forests.
   The link between landscape structure and biodiversity is provided
   through the emergence of ecological understanding of species richness,
   species-habitat or niches, and metapopulation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{The males of Nezara viridula (Heteroptera, Pentatomidae) produce a blend
   of four terpenoid compounds. The proportion of these four compounds
   varies among different populations. The terpenoid content of the
   volatile emission from individual males of a French population was
   monitored for several days with headspace solid-phase microextraction.
   The total amount of terpenoid compounds collected on an SPME fiber from
   one virgin male bug emitting over the course of 1 hr was very variable
   between samples. More than 50\% of males released pheromone, at least
   during one part of the observation period. The relative percentages of
   bisabolene, nerolidol, trans-bisabolene epoxide, and cis-bisabolene
   epoxide were calculated and compared. The proportion of nerolidol in the
   blend showed a large dispersion between samples and a high coefficient
   of variation. The percentage values for bisabolene and its trans and cis
   epoxides were less dispersed, and the coefficients of variation for both
   epoxides were low. The proportion of trans epoxide relative to the two
   epoxides, which has been considered characteristic of pheromone strains
   of N. viridula, showed the smallest coefficient of variation. The
   repeatability index (RI) varied between 0.57 and 0.85 for the four
   compounds. Repeatability was particularly high for the two epoxide
   isomers. Stability in epoxide production was confirmed by statistical
   analysis (ANOVA), which revealed significant differences in the
   percentages of cis and trans epoxides between individuals.
   Correspondingly, the RI of the ratio of trans to cis + trans epoxides
   was over 0.8. Our study confirms the existence of an interindividual
   variation of the trans to cis epoxide ratio within populations of Nezara
   viridula but indicates that each individual reproducibly emits both
   isomers in the same proportion day after day.}},

Abstract = {{A combined epidemiological-exposure panel study was conducted during the
   summer of 1998 in Baltimore, Maryland. The objectives of the exposure
   analysis component of the 28-day study were to investigate the
   statistical relationships between particulate matter (PM) and related
   co-pollutants from numerous spatial boundaries associated with an
   elderly population, provide daily mass concentrations needed for the
   epidemiological assessment, and perform an extensive personal exposure
   assessment. Repeated 24-h integrated PM2.5 (n=394) and PM10 (n=170) data
   collections corresponding to stationary residential central indoor,
   individual apartment, residential outdoor and ambient monitoring were
   obtained using the same sampling methodology An additional 325 PM2.5
   personal air samples were collected from it pool of 21 elderly (65+
   years of age) subjects. These subjects were residents of the 18-story
   retirement facility where residential monitoring was conducted. hi ean
   daily central indoor and residential apartment ment concentrations were
   approximately 10 mug/m(3). Outdoor and ambient PM2.5 concentrations
   averaged 22 mug/mg with a daily range of 6.7-59.3 mug/m(3). The slope of
   the central indoor/outdoor PM2.5 mass relationship was 0.38. The average
   daily ratio of PM2.5/PM10 mass concentrations across the measurement
   sites ranged from 0.73 to 0.92. Both the central indoor and mean
   apartment PM2.5 mass concentrations were highly correlated with the
   outdoor variables (r > 0.94). The lack of traditionally recognized
   indoor sources of PM present within the facility might have accounted
   for the high degree of correlation observed between the variables.
   Results associated with the personal monitoring effort are discussed in
   depth in Part 2 of this article.}},

Abstract = {{The School Health Initiative: Environment, Learning, Disease (SHIELD)
   study is a novel school-based investigation of children's environmental
   health in economically disadvantaged urban neighborhoods of Minneapolis.
   This article describes the study design and summarizes lessons learned
   about recruiting and monitoring this historically understudied
   population. The SHIELD study focused on measuring children's exposures
   to multiple environmental stressors {[}volatile organic chemicals
   (VOCs), environmental tobacco smoke, allergens, bioaerosols, metals,
   pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), phthalates] and exploring
   related effects on respiratory health (e.g., lung function) and learning
   outcomes (e.g., standardized test scores, academic achievement). It
   involved intensive exposure monitoring, including environmental
   measurements inside and outside the children's schools and inside their
   homes, personal measurements with passive dosimeters worn by the
   children, and biological marker measurements in blood and urine. The
   SHIELD participants comprised a stratified random sample of 153
   ``index{''} children and 51 of their siblings enrolled in grades 2-5 at
   two adjacent elementary schools. The Minneapolis Public Schools (MPS)
   assisted with identifying, contacting, recruiting, and monitoring this
   population, which traditionally is difficult to study because
   families/children are highly mobile, speak a diversity of languages,
   frequently do not have a telephone, endure economic hardships, often do
   not trust researchers, and have a spectrum of unconventional lifestyles
   and living arrangements. Using a school-based approach, the overall
   SHIELD enrollment (response) rate was 56.7\%, with a wide disparity
   between English-speaking (41.7\%) and non-English-speaking (71.0\%)
   families/children. Most children remained involved in die study through
   both monitoring sessions and exhibited an acceptable degree of
   compliance with study protocols, including providing blood and urine
   samples. Results indicate that it is both practical and affordable to
   conduct probability-based exposure studies in this population, but that
   it is also important to improve our understanding of factors (e.g.,
   cultural, economic, psychological, social) affecting the willingness of
   families/children to participate in such studies, with special emphasis
   on developing cost-effective recruitment methods.}},

Abstract = {{The elevated exposure of children to hormonally active dietary
   phytoestrogens has led to the need for rapid, sensitive, and precise
   assays for phytoestrogen metabolites in physiological matrices. Here we
   report the development of a high-performance liquid chromatography
   (HPLC) MS/MS method for the quantitative detection of seven
   phytoestrogens in human serum and urine. The method uses enzymatic
   deconjugation of the phytoestrogen metabolites followed by solid phase
   extraction (SPE) and reverse-phase HPLC. The phytoestrogens are detected
   using a Sciex API III heated nebulizer atmospheric pressure chemical
   ionization (HN-APCI) interface coupled with tandem mass spectrometry.
   This method allows the detection of the primary dietary phytoestrogens
   (isoflavones and lignans) in human serum and urine with limits of
   detection (LODs) in the low parts per billion range. The combination of
   tandem mass spectrometry and chromatographic separation of the analytes
   helps ensure the selectivity of the method. Stable isotope-labeled
   internal standards for all seven analytes improve the precision of the
   assay, resulting in interday CV values of <10\% for most compounds
   studied. The accuracy and precision of the method were monitored over
   time using quality control (QC) samples containing known amounts of
   phytoestrogens. The majority of phytoestrogens in human sera and urine
   are present as their glucuronide and sulfate conjugates. Therefore, the
   thoroughness of deconjugation for each sample was monitored by the
   addition of a conjugated internal standard and subsequent detection of
   deconjugated compound. This method proves to be efficacious for
   measuring baseline urinary phytoestrogen levels in the American
   population and should prove useful for assessing the modulatory effects
   of dietary phytoestrogens on endocrine disrupter action in children.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored movements of small mammals resident on floodplains
   susceptible to spring floods to assess whether and how these animals
   respond to habitat inundation. The 2 floodplains were associated with
   6th order river segments in a semiarid landscape; each was predictably
   inundated each year as snowmelt progressed in headwater areas of the
   Rocky Mountains. Data from live trapping, radiotelemetry, and
   microtopographic surveys indicated that Peromyscus maniculatus, Microtus
   montanus, and Dipodomys ordii showed different responses to inundation,
   but all reflected a common tendency to remain in the original home range
   until ``forced{''} to leave. The reluctance of Dipodomys ordii to
   abandon the home burrow often resulted in death in situ, whereas
   individual P. maniculatus and M, montanus moved to nearby higher ground
   but not necessarily toward upland. This behavior could lead to occupancy
   of an island that disappeared as floodwaters rose. Peromyscus
   maniculatus climbed into sapling cottonwood, but the quality of such
   arboreal refuges was unclear. We found only weak support for the
   hypothesis that displacement was temporary; most floodplain residents,
   including P. maniculatus, disappeared over the flood period. No
   secondary effect from flooding on adjacent upland small-mammal
   assemblages was detected. Our data suggest populations of facultatively
   riparian, nonarboreal small mammals such as M. montanus and D. ordii
   generally experience habitat inundation as a catastrophy, Terrestrial
   species capable of using an arboreal refuge, such as P. maniculatus,
   face a more variable risk, determined in part by timing and duration of
   the flood event. River regulation can affect both sets of risks.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution and seasonal dynamics of cyst populations of the spring
   bloom dinoflagellate Scrippsiella hangoei were studied in surface
   sediments on the southwest coast of Finland, Baltic Sea. In situ
   germination was assessed by monitoring the fraction of empty cysts and
   chlorophyll a fluorescence in cyst populations at different coastal
   sites throughout the annual cycle. Scrippsiella hangoei resting cysts
   were widely distributed in the study area and occurred in exceptionally
   large numbers (magnitudes of 10(4)-10(6) cysts cm(-3)) at all sampling
   locations between the innermost parts of the coastal archipelago and the
   open Gulf of Finland. The decreases in cyst number in winter and the
   increases occurring in late spring reflected the dynamics of germination
   and encystment of the species. Chlorophyll fluorescence appeared in
   mid-winter in similar to 40\% of cysts from well-aerated basins and
   6-15\% of cysts from temporarily anoxic sediments. A generally low
   increase in the proportion of empty cysts indicated that only a part of
   the potentially germinable cysts actually germinates. Given the high
   cyst concentrations in the sediments, the potential for germination is
   considerable, despite the environmentally and physiologically determined
   losses. In contrast, the size of the vegetative inoculum is very low,
   indicating that the survival of germlings is problematic under harsh
   winter conditions. This is an unusual life cycle strategy; however, the
   early release of cells into the water column provides a high probability
   for successful bloom initiation under the unpredictable meteorological
   conditions in winter and early spring, which often lead to the sudden
   onset of favourable growth conditions.}},

Abstract = {{It was hypothesized that grazing management could mitigate grasshopper
   outbreaks on native rangeland in the northern Great Plains. Key
   practices would require deliberate variation in timing and intensity of
   grazing events, preservation of canopy during critical periods of
   grasshopper development, and reductions in areas of bare soil. The
   twice-over rotational grazing system appeared compatible with those
   requirements. Grasshopper population trends were monitored during
   1993-1995 and 1997-1998 on commercial native rangeland under twice-over
   rotational grazing vs traditional season-long grazing. A ubiquitous pest
   grasshopper, Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius), occurred at every
   sample site during each year in numbers sufficient to provide life
   history parameters for comparison between treatments. Under rotational
   grazing, the nymphs developed significantly slower and their
   stage-specific survival rates were significantly lower and less
   variable. Consequently, significantly fewer adults were produced
   significantly later in the season under rotational grazing. Seasonal
   presence of all grasshopper species combined averaged 3.3X higher under
   season-long grazing than under rotational grazing. Local outbreaks that
   generated 18 and 27 adult grasshoppers per m(2) under season-long
   grazing in 1997 and 1998, respectively, did not occur under rotational
   grazing. The outbreaks consumed 91\% and 168\%, respectively, as much
   forage as had been allocated for livestock, as opposed to 10\% and 23\%,
   respectively, under rotational grazing. Of 9 important grasshopper
   species, none were significantly more abundant at rotational sites than
   at season-long sites. Three species that were primary contributors to
   outbreaks under season-long grazing remained innocuous under rotational
   grazing. It therefore appears that outbreak suppression through grazing
   management is feasible in the northern Great Plains.}},

Abstract = {{Species composition and turnover that have occurred in a series of
   permanent sample plots established during the 1930s and 1940s in
   Budongo, a semi-deciduous Ugandan forest, are reported. The plots were
   established as part of a sequence first used to describe forest
   succession, five of which have been maintained and which were last
   measured in 1992-1993. One plot (plot 7) provides 53 y of data from
   old-growth pristine forest. Plot 15 was established in wooded grassland
   at the forest edge and is now closed high forest. Evaluation of the
   remaining three plots is complicated by silvicultural interventions
   carried out in the 1950s. Forty species have been added since the first
   evaluations and a total of 188 tree species (over 80\% of Budongo's
   forest tree flora, and including two exotics) has now been recorded from
   within the plots. The pattern of shade-tolerance in the original plot
   series conforms to patterns expected for succession with an increasing
   proportion of shade-tolerant species with development, and large stems
   appearing to `lag behind' smaller stems in this respect. The time series
   data are less consistent, and while plot 7 increased in the proportion
   of shade-tolerant stems through time, the proportion of shade-tolerant
   species actually declines. Stem-turnover (the mean of mortality and
   recruitment) slowed with implied successional stage. Most species have a
   higher recruitment than mortality rate and stem numbers have thus
   increased in all plots. This is most pronounced in the putatively `early
   successional' plot. Stem size structure has changed within the plots,
   with an increased proportion of smaller stems. Species show different
   rates of turnover and these vary from plot to plot and period to period.
   In plot 7, the overall mortality rate decreased with initial stem size.
   Estimates imply that some tree species may easily live longer than 500 y
   after reaching 10 cm DBH, and that 1000 y is possible. The importance of
   large trees in determining forest dynamics is illustrated by the finding
   that death of only seven stems in plot 7 contributed over 60\% of net
   basal area losses recorded over the 53-y observation period. Many of the
   observed patterns were not predicted and could only have been found by
   long-term studies.}},

Abstract = {{In the Indian desert. the economics of mining is second only to
   agriculture in importance. However, research on the rehabilitation of
   land disturbed by mining has only recently received serious attention.
   An attempt has been made to determine both the qualitative and
   quantitative success of rehabilitation plans used to revegetate
   limestone mine spoils in an area near Barna. northwest arid India.
   Rehabilitation success was achieved using a combination of rainwater
   harvesting techniques, soil amendment application approaches, plant
   establishment methods and the selection of appropriate germplasm
   material (trees, shrubs and grasses). It is expected that the resulting
   vegetative cover will be capable of self-perpetuation under natural
   conditions while at the same time meeting the land-use needs of the
   local people. The minespoils have adequate levels of the major nutrients
   (except P, Mo and Se) for proper plant and grazing animal health. Levels
   of organic matter are low whereas total B concentrations are
   exceptionally high. Also, the population of soil fungi, Azotobactor, and
   nitrifying bacteria is negligible. Enhanced plant growth was achieved in
   treated plots, compared to control plots, where spoil moisture storage
   was improved by 5-45 per cent. Due to the decomposition of farmyard
   manure and nitrogen fixation by planted leguminous plant species, the
   electrical conductance of treated mine spoils increased threefold, CaCO3
   content decreased from 20.0 to 5.2 per cent, and organic carbon, P, K,
   and biological activity increased significantly. The rehabilitation
   protocol used at the site appears to have been successful because plant
   self-regeneration is occurring. The increased diversity of woody
   perennials resulted in `dominance' being better shared among species and
   `evenness' being increased within the plant community elements. The
   early to mid-successional trends are continuing for six years following
   initial rehabilitation. This study developed methods for the
   rehabilitation of lands mined for limestone and has also resulted in an
   understanding of rehabilitation processes in arid regions with an
   emphasis on the long-term monitoring of rehabilitation success.

Abstract = {{The Loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta is a species sensitive to
   environmental changes caused by human activity. Stranded specimens found
   along the Adriatic, Baltic and Northern coasts seem to indicate that
   their diet, reproduction habits and aerials are the most affected
   ecological aspects of these organisms. We sampled liver, muscle and fat
   in C. caretta to detect the presence of polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs)
   including congeners with meta and par a chlorine substitutions
   (dioxin;like planar configuration). The specimens analysed in this study
   come from the Adriatic Sea and were provided by the Fondazione Cetacea,
   member of the `Progetto Tartarughe'. Results have revealed average Sigma
   PCB concentrations of 119 ng/g w.w. in liver, 15 ng/g w.w. in muscle and
   334 ng/g w.w. in fat. Differences were found among concentrations of
   single congeners and of each class of isomers, which were detected as
   well. Coplanar PCB distribution was consistent with Sigma PCBs, as
   contamination levels mere higher in fat with respect to Liver and
   muscle. Such finding suggests not only that metabolic activity takes
   place in the liver, but that these contaminants bioaccumulate
   differently in the different tissues. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Because recalcitrant seeds are not desiccation-tolerant they must be
   stored moist. Their limited storage potential presents significant
   practical problems, but the cause of viability loss is not known. It has
   been suggested that a stress-induced metabolic imbalance can develop
   during storage that results in free-radical generation and consequent
   damage. To investigate this hypothesis, the presence of a stable free
   radical, lipid peroxidation and representative enzymatic and
   nonenzymatic protection mechanisms against oxidative attack were
   monitored in nondormant recalcitrant seeds during moist storage. A
   comparison was made between seeds of a short-lived subtropical species
   (Avicennia marina) and two longer-lived temperate species (Quercus robur
   and Castanea sativa). As a test of the hypothesis, seeds of both
   temperate species were held under conditions of elevated temperature and
   oxygen concentration to develop different rates of respiration during
   storage. The number of normal seedlings produced from seeds of the two
   temperate species declined during storage, but viability remained high,
   so effects of ageing were not confounded with an increasing proportion
   of dead seeds in the population. Under these conditions, lipid
   peroxidation changed little over the storage period, although there was
   evidence of accumulation of a stable free radical in Q. robur axes.
   However, this response was not affected by storage conditions that
   elevated respiration rates. In the shorter-lived A. marina seeds
   viability declined soon after the start of storage, but the significant
   increase in free radicals shown by EPR measurement was only evident when
   an increasing percentage of the seed population was no longer viable.
   Changes in the activity of scavenging enzymes and the concentration of
   antioxidants were time-dependent and not related to respiration rates.
   Therefore, in the present work, no consistent evidence was found to show
   that metabolism-induced free-radical activity was a significant
   contributing factor to pre-mortem deterioration in moist-stored
   recalcitrant seeds.}},

Abstract = {{The Asian kelp Undaria pinnatifida (Laminariales, Phaeophyceae) was
   first recorded in New Zealand in 1987 and has since spread via shipping
   traffic and other vectors to a number of ports and harbours. Here we
   report the results of laboratory and field studies devised to assess the
   potential for natural dispersal of Undaria from a founding population.
   Under laboratory conditions, > 90\% of Undaria spores were viable in
   seawater for at least 5 days, with some viable after 14 days. Spores
   artificially released into a tidal current resulted later in sporophytes
   appearing on artificial surfaces positioned 10 m down-current of the
   release point. Field monitoring of a founding population within the
   Marlborough Sounds, New Zealand, suggested that natural populations
   spread at least 100 m yr(-1). Reasons for the differences between the
   dispersal distances of the artificially released spores (10 m) and
   natural populations (100 m) are discussed. We propose that spore
   dispersal from fixed stands of (Indaria results primarily in short-range
   spread (metres to hundreds of metres), with dispersal of fragments or
   whole sporophytes facilitating spread at scales of hundreds of metres to
   kilometres.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated effects of both physical and biological components of the
   environment on growth of Pantoea agglomerans on inoculated pear and
   apple blossoms and on spread of the bacterium to blossoms on
   noninoculated trees. The center three rows of 0.35- to 0.5-ha blocks of
   four pear cultivars and four apple cultivars were sprayed with a
   suspension of streptomycin-resistant P. agglomerans strain C9-1S (C9-1S)
   at 20 to 60\% and 60 to 90\% bloom. Cultivars were chosen to create a
   sequence of continuous bloom from late March (d'Anjou pear) through
   mid-May (Red Rome apple). Each cultivar block was quartered into plots;
   two plots were treated twice with streptomycin sulfate near mid- and
   full bloom to suppress populations of indigenous bacterial epiphytes and
   the other two plots were treated with water. Colonization of blossoms by
   C9-1S and by indigenous bacterial epiphytes were monitored on inoculated
   trees and along transects of noninoculated trees. Immediately after
   spraying, C9-1S was detected principally on blossoms sampled from
   inoculated trees. As bloom progressed, trees up to 18 m from inoculated
   trees had high proportions of blossoms colonized by C9-1S. Streptomycin
   significantly (P less than or equal to 0.05) reduced incidence of
   isolation and size of detectable populations of culturable bacteria
   (indigenous bacteria plus C9-1S) from pear blossoms in 1998 and from
   apple blossoms in both 1998 and 1999, but the antibiotic treatment did
   not affect incidence of isolation, size of detectable populations, or
   spread of C9-1S compared to the water-treated control in any experiment.
   Across all cultivars, relative area under the curve for size of
   detectable populations of C9-1S on inoculated trees and for incidence of
   isolation of C9-1S from noninoculated trees was positively correlated
   with mean degree hours per day during bloom (r = 0.61 to 0.73) and
   negatively correlated with the proportion of days with rain (r = -0.79
   to -0.84). The results indicate that establishment and growth of C9-1S
   on pome fruit flowers was not strongly affected by streptomycin or by
   competition from indigenous bacterial epiphytes and, as with Erwinia
   amylovora, temperature is an important environmental variable affecting
   successful spread of this biological control agent from blossom to
   blossom.}},

Abstract = {{Ictalurid populations, including those of the Neosho madtom Noturus
   placidus, have been monitored in the Neosho River basin since the U.S.
   Fish and Wildlife Sel vice listed the Neosho madtom as threatened in
   1991. The Neosho madtom presently occurs only in the Neosho River basin,
   whose hydrologic regime, physical habitat, and water quality have been
   altered by the construction and operation of reservoirs. Our objective
   was to assess changes in ictalurid densities, habitat, water quality,
   and hydrology in relation to the presence of a main-stern reservoir in
   the Neosho River basin. Study sites were characterized using habitat
   quality as measured by substrate size, water quality as measured by
   standard physicochemical measures, and indicators of hydrologic
   alteration (IHA) as calculated from stream gauge information from the
   U.S. Geological Survey. Site estimates of ictalurid densities were
   collected by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service annually from 1991 to
   1998, with the exception of 1993. Water quality and habitat measurements
   documented reduced turbidity and altered substrate composition in the
   Neosho River basin below John Redmond Dam. The effects of the dam on
   flow were indicated by changes in the short- and long-term minimum and
   maximum flows. Positive correlations between observed Neosho madtom
   densities and increases in minimum flow suggest that increased minimum
   flows could be used to enhance Neosho madtom populations. Positive
   correlations between Neosho madtom densities and increased flows in the
   winter and spring months as well as the date of the l-d annual minimum
   flow indicate the potential importance of the timing of increased flows
   to Neosho madtoms. Because of the positive relationships that we found
   between the densities of Neosho madtoms and those of channel catfish
   Ictalurus punctatus, stonecats Noturus flavus, and other catfishes,
   alterations in flow that benefit Neosho madtom populations will probably
   benefit other members of the benthic fish community of the Neosho River.}},

Abstract = {{Double-focusing sector-field, inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry was used for the determination of 71 elements in scalp hair
   and fingernail samples from an urban population group living in the
   north-east of Sweden. Samples (n = 114 for hair and n = 96 for nails)
   were taken from subjects without known occupational exposure to metals.
   From these results, concentration ranges were calculated and compared
   with published intervals. Statistical analysis was used to elucidate
   differences according to sex, age and smoking habit. It was found that
   significant correlations exist between different elements in hair and
   nails, as well as between hair and nail concentrations for several
   elements. Strong positive correlation for Hg, Cd, Pb, Sb and Bi levels
   between these media confirms that both can be used for exposure
   assessment for these elements. Several examples on the use of
   distribution patterns for the rare-earth elements (REE) and of Pb
   isotope ratios for assessment of exposure are given. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traps baited with synthetic aggregation pheromones of Carpophilus
   hemipterus (L.), Carpophilus mutilatus Erichson and Carpophilus
   davidsoni Dobson and fermenting bread dough were used to identify the
   fauna and monitor the seasonal abundance of Carpophilus spp. in
   insecticide-treated peach and nectarine orchards in the Gosford area of
   coastal New South Wales. In four orchards 67 178 beetles were trapped
   during 1994-1995, with C. davidsoni (82\%) and Carpophilus gaveni
   (Dobson) (12.2\%) dominating catches. Five species (C. hemipterus, C.
   mutilatus, Carpophilus marginellus Motschulsky, Calpophilus humeralis
   (F.) and an unidentified species) each accounted for 0.2-3.2\% of
   trapped beetles. Carpophilus davidsoni was most abundant during late
   September-early October but numbers declined rapidly during October,
   usually before insecticides were applied. Spring populations of
   Carpophilus spp. were very large in 1994-1995 (1843-2588 per trap per
   week). However, despite a preharvest population decline of approximately
   95\% and 2-11 applications of insecticide, 14-545 beetles per trap per
   week (above the arbitrary fruit damage threshold of 10 beetles per trap
   per week) were recorded during the han est period and fruit damage
   occurred at three of the four orchards. Lower preharvest populations in
   1995-1996 (< 600 per trap per week) and up to six applications of
   insecticide resulted in < 10 beetles per trap per week during most of
   the harvest period and minimal or no fruit damage. The implications of
   these results for the integrated management of Carpophilus spp. in
   coastal and inland areas of southeastern Australia are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Nine insect species endemic to tropical America have been released into
   the Northern Territory as biological control agents for Mimosa pigra L.
   (Mimosaceae). To date, few studies have been published that quantify the
   abundance of these agents post-release. Hence, populations of adult
   agents in three stands of ill. pigra were monitored using Malaise traps.
   Trap catches frequently contained the lepidopteran agents Carmenta
   mimosa Eichlin and Passoa and Neurostrota gunniella (Busck). Neurostrota
   gunniella, which was first released in 1989, was the most abundant of
   all the agents caught, irrespective of the: stand of M. pigra where
   trapping was conducted. The three coleopteran agents (namely
   Acanthoscelides Schonherr spp., Chlamisus mimosae Karren and
   Coclocephalapion Wagner spp.) were caught less frequently. Two recently
   released beetles, Chalcodermus serripes Fahraeus and Sibinia fastigiata
   Clark, were not caught. Trap catches of Acanthoscelides spp. were
   greatest during the late dry season with smaller catches during the mid-
   to late wet season. Chlamisus mimosae was most abundant during the dry
   to dry-wet transition. Neurostrota gunniella was generally most abundant
   during the dry season. The abundances of Cn. mimosa and Coelocephalapion
   spp. exhibited little seasonality. Malaise trapping is recommended as
   part of a long-term monitoring program to quantify agent populations and
   their impact upon M. pigra.}},

Abstract = {{Line transect sampling is a well-known method for estimating densities
   of wildlife populations and can be a useful alternative to the
   traditional methods for timber cruising when assessing objects and
   species of interest in relation to biodiversity, This paper presents
   results from a field test of line transect sampling for inanimate
   objects in boreal forest, focusing on the surveyors' influence on
   estimates under different surveying conditions. The method was tested by
   II surveyors in northern Sweden in two forest types and for two
   different object types. An underestimation of between -0.3 and -22.2\%
   was found, depending on the surveying conditions and the model used for
   the detection function. The underestimation is partly due to violation
   of the assumption that all objects on or very close to the survey line
   are detected. It was found that systematic differences among surveyors
   were generally moderate. At most, the coefficient of variation for
   surveyor effect was 6.8\%. Still, this size of surveyor effect can be
   problematic for long-term monitoring, where systematic differences among
   surveyors' estimates may indicate illusory changes or disguise real
   trends. When comparing line transect sampling with other sampling
   methods, the increased variation in estimates caused by surveyors'
   systematic and random errors as well as the variation caused by model
   selection must be considered. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Leks have recently been defined as male display aggregations that
   females attend primarily for the purpose of mating. This is an extended
   version of previous definitions, as a clear-cut definition of leks is
   difficult to obtain. Four criteria should be verified to identify a
   lekking species: (i) there is no male parental investment beyond the
   sperm; (ii) males aggregate at specific sites for display; (iii) the
   only resource females find on the lek is the male, i.e. the male genes.
   (iv) females can select her mate(s), although the necessity of this
   latter condition for lekking species has been highly debated. We applied
   these criteria to the endangered little bustard Tetrax tetrax, a species
   that is claimed to show an exploded lek mating system, but for which
   this has never been fully investigated. We monitored a population of
   little bustards in western France during 2 years to investigate the two
   central criteria in the assessment of their mating system: male
   aggregation in arenas and lack of consistent resources in male
   territories. We analysed the spatial distribution of little bustard male
   territories, the individual variation in size, and the land use
   characteristics of male territories, with particular attention to the
   habitats that may be considered as defensible resources. Displaying
   males showed an aggregated spatial distribution over the study area
   during the 2 years of survey. Male territories were rather large
   (19+/-16 ha), but a large among-male variability in territory size was
   observed. Land use within the territories included mainly permanent and
   semi-permanent crops. The variability in land use among territories
   suggests also that resources found within male territories were selected
   according to male needs (food and display) rather than to female needs
   (permanent crops that are more appropriate for reproduction). The mating
   system of the little bustard seems to match the general (and extended)
   definition of leks, at least in some populations. However. limits
   between resource defence polygyny and extreme exploded or resource-based
   leks are thin and unclear, and the little bustard is a good example of
   how lek definitions may be difficult to apply in non clear-cut empirical
   situations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past years the functional deficiencies observed in the sea
   urchin Sphaerechinus granularis from the Bay of Brest (France) have led
   us to select several populations within this species to assess water
   quality in the Bay of Brest. The present study reports on the comparison
   of the quality of embryonic development and of the level of metal
   contamination in sea urchin gonads and gut wall in four populations.
   Three of them lived in the Bay of Brest, and the last one was considered
   a reference, being settled in the Glenan Archipelago in southern
   Brittany (France). The sea urchin population living at the mouth of the
   River Aulne, at the Armorique Point, seemed to be the most affected, for
   it displayed the highest rate of blockage and the longest delay in
   embryonic development along with the highest concentrations in heavy
   metals, i.e., Fe, Cu, Pb, Cd, and Hg, in the gut wall and in the gonads.
   A comparison with previous data highlighted a degradation of health
   conditions in the population living at Marloux in the vicinity of Brest
   harbor. The comparison of the metal levels detected in individuals from
   these two populations with the data reported in the literature allowed
   us to conclude for a local contamination of the bay waters by Fe and Hg.
   In addition, this study also revealed that Zn and Cd concentrations were
   sometimes higher than the maximum values reported in the literature and
   evidenced an increase of contamination by Cu and Pb over the period of
   study; it should be noted, however, that these values were not excess
   levels. Our investigations also suggest that Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu levels
   should be monitored in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The utility of microplate and electrophoretic assays for detection of
   biochemical and physiological mechanisms underlying resistance to
   profenofos in the tobacco budworm, Heliothis virescens (F.), was
   assessed. Esterase (EST) activities were significantly higher in
   profenofos-resistant than -susceptible larvae, and activities were
   highly correlated (r(2) = 0.87) with resistance to profenofos. Both
   qualitative and quantitative variation was observed in electrophoretic
   gels stained with alpha -and beta -naphthyl acetates. Staining of ESTs
   was more intense with resistant larvae than those from a susceptible
   strain. In addition, a band (designated A') was expressed in larvae from
   profenofos-resistant strains, but not in larvae from an
   insecticide-susceptible strain. The frequency of expression of A'
   increased following selection with profenofos and was detected in 100\%
   of the individuals from a profenofos-selected strain. The appearance of
   this band coincided with the decreased expression of a second band
   (designated A). A similar pattern (overexpression of A' and
   underexpression of A) also was observed in larvae from field-collected
   strains. Finally, reduction in the activity or the sensitivity of
   acetylcholinesterase to inhibition by chlorpyrifos oxon was observed in
   laboratory-selected and field-collected larvae that expressed resistance
   to profenofos. These results suggest that microplate and electrophoretic
   assays can be utilized as complementary tools for detecting and
   monitoring profenofos resistance in H. virescens. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss,

Abstract = {{Numbers of Bell's Vireos (Vireo bellii) have declined throughout much of
   the breeding range in recent years, yet little information exists to
   determine factors that are causing these declines. We studied Bell's
   Vireos nesting in grassland-shrub habitats at two study areas in central
   Missouri to determine reproductive performance, survival, and population
   growth potential. Birds were color banded and observed during the
   breeding seasons of 1996, 1997, and 1998 to determine seasonal
   fecundity. We monitored 124 breeding pairs (127 pair years) and 213
   nests. Density declined from 1.00 to 0.80 territories per 10 ha at the
   first site and increased from 1.11 to 1.33 at the second site during the
   study. Mean nesting success was 31 +/- SE of 0.03\% overall and ranged
   from 13 to 42\% among years and study areas; 57\% of the pairs fledged
   at least one young. Low annual production was a function of high rates
   of nest predation (41\% of all nests observed, accounting for 44 to 78\%
   of daily nest mortality annually) and nest parasitism by Brown-headed
   Cowbirds (Molothrus ater; 29\% of nests observed, 17 to 37\% of daily
   nest mortality annually). Mean seasonal fecundity was 1.60 young fledged
   per pair per year (range 1.00 to 1.79). Annual survival of adults was 61
   +/- 0.04\% and was higher than previously reported. We used our
   estimates of seasonal fecundity and annual survival of adults to
   determine the finite rate of increase (lambda) for our study population.
   Our study areas seemingly comprised sink habitats (lambda = 0.85). Thus,
   the vireos on our study areas likely were limited by low reproductive
   success. Population declines also may be caused by habitat loss, which
   highlights the need for investigation of historical and current rates of
   loss of grassland-shrub habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The exotic shrub Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius) has invaded large
   areas of eucalypt woodland at Barrington Tops, New South Wales, where it
   forms dense stands that have significant impacts on vegetation
   structure, flora and fauna. Data are presented from four 25 m(2) plots,
   which have been studied since 1985. Two plots were located in uniform
   broom thickets of different ages, and two were located across the
   margins of broom stands, which have since expanded to cover the entire
   plots. All broom plants in the plots (other than young seedlings, which
   were counted) were mapped, tagged and monitored annually. New seedlings
   appeared annually, but there was no relationship between their numbers
   (varying between years) and subsequent recruitment of older plants. The
   probability of seedlings reaching first flowering was less than 2\%, and
   of surviving to mature size (> 10 cm(2) basal area) was negligible.
   Seedlings mainly died through suppression (shade). Individuals less than
   50 cm high were also browsed. Recruitment occurred only where light
   levels were high, either before closure of the broom canopy or after
   senescence had led to canopy opening. From approximately 12-30 years
   after initial invasion, broom stands underwent self-thinning of mature
   plants, accelerated by collapse of plants on to each other. Recruitment
   of new, maturing plants, after this period produced a stand that was
   less dense than that found after initial invasion. Broom is creating
   more disturbance-prone environments due to its impacts on other biota,
   likely alterations to the fire regime, and by harbouring feral pigs.
   Further disturbance favours broom, and elsewhere it has resulted in
   massive seedling regeneration. While fire or other disturbance can be
   used to stimulate germination, and thereby reduce a large part of the
   soil seed bank, denser broom infestations are likely to result unless
   follow-up treatments can be applied over long time periods. A wiser
   management option, at least in the short term, may be avoidance of all
   disturbance, especially for stands of mature broom.}},

Abstract = {{One of the major constraints for banana production in Uganda is the
   banana weevil, Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), (Coleoptera:
   Curculionidae). Investigations were carried out to evaluate the efficacy
   of maize, soil-based and oil formulations of an indigenous isolate of
   Beauveria bassiana for the control of the banana weevil. Weekly trapping
   of weevils over a 9-month monitoring period showed significant reduction
   in unmarked and marked weevil population in B, bassiana treated plots.
   Application of maize formulation at 2 x 10(15) conidia ha-(1) proved
   most effective reducing the weevil populations by 63-72\% within 8 weeks
   after a single application. The soil based formulation at 2 x 10(14)
   conidia ha(-1) was intermediate while the oil formulation at 6x10(15)
   conidial ha(-1) was least effective. Trapping efficiency declined in B.
   bassiana treated and untreated banana plots but was greatest in the
   latter.}},

Abstract = {{ADAPTATION, modification and expansion are ever-present elements in the
   day-to-day operation of Bluestem Solid Waste Agency in Cedar Rapids,
   Iowa. Since 1994, Bluestem - a part- nership between Cedar Rapids and
   Linn County - has operated the largest composting facility in Iowa,
   processing 100,000 tons of residential and industrial feedstocks
   annually. Servicing a population of 180,000, Bluestem anticipates
   processing 120,000 tons of compostables in 2001. A BioCycle report one
   year ago described how the agency innovated a capacity-increasing site
   modification, upgraded equipment and improved bagging operations to meet
   the needs of handling greater volumes. After another 12 months of
   successful operation, Bluestem continues its tradition of adapting and
   modifying procedures to boost market potential, landfill diversion and
   system performance. A \$115,000 ``pyramid-type{''} storage structure
   adjacent to Bluestem's 60-by-150 foot bagging building was constructed
   last November. The storage building - fabricated by Dome Corporation of
   North America - holds up to 1,400 tons of screened compost. Prior to
   storage, compost is put through a three-eighths inch screen. The storage
   building increases site capacity and by eliminating outdoor stockpiling,
   reduces moisture retention to ensure high quality compost. Other quality
   control measures include inspection of all compostable material before
   being unloaded on-site and constant monitoring of moisture, aeration and
   structure. Targeted moisture is 60 percent. Appropriate mixing of
   feedstock and weekly turning of windrows using two Seat compost turners
   help control odor. In addition, Bluestem has retained E \& A
   Environmental to provide consulting and address odor emission concerns.
   The agency employs a thorough record keeping system to ensure
   comprehensive site management. Bluestem is one of two facilities in Iowa
   that has enrolled in the Seal of Testing Assurance (STA) Program - a
   pilot program initiated by the U.S. Composting Council. (Chamness
   Technology, Inc. of Blairsburg is the other Iowa site in the program to
   establish quality compost standards.).}},

Abstract = {{During the spring and summer upwelling season (April-August) of the
   years 1997-99, we monitored settlement of juvenile crabs and sea urchins
   ill northern California. Oceanographic conditions during these three
   years included El Nino in 1997-98, and La Nina in 1999. Prior data had
   shown strong annual settlement ill years during which an intra-annual
   upwelling/relaxation mechanism was dominant. During active upwelling,
   invertebrate and fish larvae were retained south of Point Reyes. When
   winds relaxed, larvae could be transported northward and onshore in
   warm. less saline water, and settle on our collectors at the Bodega
   Marine Laboratory During years in which this upwelling/relaxation
   Mechanism dominated and salinity was inversely correlated with
   temperature, higher temperatures, which represented relaxation flow were
   associated with cancrid crab settlement. The settlement response in 1997
   and 1998 was similar to that of earlier years, but 1999 was quits
   different. In 1997, the lack of an inverse correlation between
   temperature and salinity indicated that wind-driven upwelling/relaxation
   was not dominant, and cancrid crab settlement was not correlated with
   temperature. In 1998, temperature and salinity were inversely
   correlated, but wind and temperature were not as highly correlated as in
   years prior to 1997. Settlement appeared to be driven by relaxation, but
   the relationship was not as strong as in previous years. Although they
   appeared to settle during relaxation events, neither sea urchins nor
   non-cancrid crabs settled in relation to temperature in 1997-99. nor in
   most earlier years. In 1999, strong, constant upwelling winds resulted
   in no relaxation events, and settlement was an order of magnitude lower
   than in any previous year. On interannual scales, data from 1997-99 were
   consistent with previous data for cancrid crabs, showing a negative
   correlation with wind stress, but 1999 was riot consistent with previous
   findings of a negative correlation between temperature and settlement of
   non-cancrid crabs.}},

Abstract = {{Stocking with offspring of local wild fish, so-called supportive
   breeding, is often advocated as an alternative to stocking domesticated
   fish. However, it is important to ensure that supportive breeding does
   not result in inbreeding and loss of genetic variability. We analysed
   eight microsatellite loci in samples of wild and hatchery-reared brown
   trout (Salmo trutta) from three populations subject to supportive
   breeding. For calibrating statistical procedures, we included two test
   samples of reared offspring for which the precise number of parent fish
   was known and a sample from a further wild reference population. Three
   different statistical procedures were used to detect population
   bottlenecks and loss of variability: (i) a randomization test for
   comparing allelic diversity between samples; (ii) estimates of effective
   number of breeders from gametic-phase disequilibrium; and (iii) a test
   for assessing population bottlenecks based on detecting deviations from
   mutation-drift equilibrium. All three procedures were useful but they
   also exhibited different strengths and limitations, with the test for
   population bottlenecks probably being the single most useful procedure
   for routine monitoring. In two populations subject to supportive
   breeding, there were strong indications of reduced effective population
   sizes, and significant genetic differentiation was observed between
   different samples from the same population.}},

Abstract = {{Good management models and good models for understanding biology differ
   in basic philosophy. Management models must facilitate management
   decisions despite large amounts of uncertainty about the managed
   populations. Such models must be based on parameters that can be
   estimated readily must explicitly account for uncertainty, and should be
   simple to understand and implement In contrast biological models are
   designed to elucidate the workings of biology,and should not be
   constrained by management concerns. We illustrate the need to
   incorporate uncertainty in management models by reviewing the inadequacy
   of using standard biological models to manage marine mammals in the
   United States. Past management was based on a simple model that,
   although it may have represented population dynamics adequately,failed
   as a management tool because the parameter that triggered management
   action was extremely difficult to estimate for the majority of
   populations. Uncertainty in parameter estimation resulted in few
   conservation actions We describe a recently adopted management scheme
   that incorporates uncertainty and its resulting implementation. The
   approach used in this simple management scheme, which was tested by
   using simulation models, incorporates uncertainty and mandates
   monitoring abundance and human-caused mortality. Although the entire
   scheme may be suitable for application to some terrestrial and marine
   problems, two features are broadly applicable: the incorporation of
   uncertainty through simulations of management and the use of
   quantitative management criteria to translate verbal objectives into
   levels of acceptable risk.}},

Title = {{Environmental models of cetacean abundance: Reducing uncertainty in
   population trends}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Trends in population abundance are often used to monitor species
   affected by human activities For highly mobile species in dynamic
   environments, however such as cetaceans in the marine realm, natural
   variability can confound attempts to detect and interpret trends in
   abundance. Environmental variability can cause dramatic shifts in the
   distribution of cetaceans, and thus abundance estimates for a fixed
   region may be based on a different proportion of the population each
   time. This adds variability decreasing statistical power to detect
   trends and introducing uncertainty whether apparent trends represent
   true changes in population size or merely reflect natural changes in the
   distribution of cetaceans To minimize these problems, surveys ideally
   would be based on species-specific design criteria that optimize
   sampling within all relevant habitat throughout a species' range. Our
   knowledge of cetacean habitats is limited how ever, and financial and
   logistic constraints generally force those surveying cetacean abundance
   to include an species within a limited geographic region. Alternately,
   it may be possible to account for environmental variability analytically
   by including models of species-environment patterns in trend analyses,
   bur this will be successful only if such models have interannual
   predictive power. I developed and evaluated generalized additive models
   of cetacean sighting rates in relation to environmental variables. I
   used data from shipboard surveys of Dall's porpoise (Phocoenoides dalli)
   and short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) conducted in 1991,
   1993, and 1996 off California. Sighting rates for these two species are
   variable and can be partially accounted for by environmental models, but
   additional surveys are needed to model species-environment relationships
   adequately. If patterns are consistent across years, generalized
   additive models may represent an effective tool for reducing uncertainty
   caused by environmental variability and for improving our ability to
   detect and interpret trends in abundance.}},

Abstract = {{When translocating individuals to found new populations, managers must
   allocate limited funds among release and monitoring activities that
   differ in method, cost, and probable result. In addition, managers are
   increasingly expected to justify the funding decisions they have made.
   Within the framework of decision analysis, we used robust optimization
   to formulate and solve different translocation problems in which both
   population growth and future funding were uncertain. Performance
   criteria included maximizing: mean population size and minimizing the
   risk (1) of undesirable population-size outcomes. Robust optimization
   provided several insights into the design of translocation strategies:
   (1) risk reduction is obtained at the expense of mean population size;
   (2) as survival of released animals becomes more important, funds should
   be allocated to release methods with lower risks of failure, regardless
   of costs; (3) the performance gain from monitoring drops as the
   proportion of a fixed budget required to pay for monitoring increases;
   and (4) as the likelihood of obtaining future funding increases, more of
   the existing budget should be spent on building release capacity rather
   than saved for future operating costs. These relationships highlight the
   importance of performance criteria and economic costs in determining
   optimal release and monitoring strategies.}},

Abstract = {{A number of ecological models have been developed to provide an
   understanding of the various biotic and abiotic components required to
   conserve biodiversity and to reconcile objectives and methods between
   those interested in the conservation of species (e.g., population
   management) and those advocating the conservation of spaces (e.g,
   protected areas). One of the better known efforts-pioneered in the
   Pacific Northwest of the United States-is a hierarchical ecological
   framework, that separates biodiversity into compositional, structural,
   and functional attributes at the genetic, population,
   community-ecosystem, and landscape levels of organization. We present an
   adaptation of this terrestrial framework consistent with the ecological
   function of marine environments. Our adaptation differs in its treatment
   of the community and ecosystem levels of organization. In our marine
   framework, the community level denotes predominantly the biotic
   community components of biodiversity, and the ecosystem level-consistent
   with marine terminology-denotes predominantly physical and chemical
   components. The community and ecosystem levels are further separated
   into those attributes based on ecological structures such as depth or
   species richness and those based on ecological processes such as water
   motion or succession. The distinction between the biotic (genetic,
   population, and community) and abiotic (ecosystem) is required because
   the biological components of biodiversity such as competition or
   predation are often more difficult to observe than the abiotic
   components such as upwellings, substratum, or temperature. As a result,
   efforts to conserve marine biodiversity are often dependent on the
   observable abiotic (ecosystem) components, which can be used as
   surrogates for the identification and monitoring of biotic (community)
   components. We used our hierarchical framework to identify, and suggest
   how conservation strategies could be implemented in marine environments
   depending on whether existing data are to be used or new data are to be
   collected.}},

Abstract = {{Data from several animal species and a few plant species indicate that
   small populations face an elevated risk of extinction. Plants are still
   underrepresented in these studies concerning the relation between
   population size and persistence. We studied the effect of population
   size on persistence among natural populations of the rare bellflower
   Campanula cervicaria in Finland We monitored 52 bellflower populations
   for 8 years and found that the mean population size decreased from 24 to
   14 during this period. Small populations with less than or equal to 5
   individuals were more prone to losing all fertile plants than were
   larger ones. Reduction in population size was nevertheless unrelated to
   the degree of population isolation measured as the distance to the
   nearest known population To test the hypothesis that offspring fitness
   is lower in small populations, we germinated bellflower seeds from
   different-sized populations in a laboratory and found that seed
   germination ability was independent of population size. The seedlings
   raised from seeds of small populations grew faster than those taken from
   larger populations. Population size was negatively related to the amount
   of shade in the habitats. In conclusion decreasing population sizes of
   C. cervicaria seemed not to be caused by lowered germination ability or
   growth rate in small populations; rather, population size reductions
   appeared to be due to closing of vegetation in the habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Two popular and profitable native North American medicinal plants,
   American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and goldenseal (Hydrastis
   canadensis), both of which are listed in Appendix II of the Convention
   on International Trade in Endangered Species of wild Fauna and nora
   (CITES) are monitored under disparate domestic strategies that are
   designed to satisfy CITES requirements. The P. quinquefolius program has
   benefited the species by encouraging U.S states to enact laws to protect
   wild populations and regulate collection and by establishing a
   transparent system under which harvest, commerce, and export can be
   monitored, evaluated, and controlled routinely. But certain programmatic
   constraints, such as insufficient funding and gaps in biological
   monitoring, undermine its effectiveness as a management strategy for the
   species. The Joint industry and government H. canadensis initiative is
   intended to give commercial traders more responsibility in monitoring
   plant trade and the federal government access to information that may
   otherwise be difficult to obtain without the help of traders. I examined
   the structure, successes, and deficiencies of the P. quinquefolius
   program, promising features of the evolving H. canadensis program,
   Turkey's management of geophytes, and other sources of information from
   federal agencies that might contribute to more effective management of
   medicinal plants in the United States. Although the main goal of
   domestic monitoring programs for P. quinquefolius and H. canadensis is
   to implement their CITES listings, it is conceivable that similar
   programs could be established for non-CITES medicinal plants, thereby
   minimizing or replacing the need for CITES protection.}},

Abstract = {{In 1998, tropical sea surface temperatures were the highest on record,
   topping off a 50-year trend for some tropical oceans. In the same year,
   coral reefs around the world suffered the most extensive and severe
   bleaching (loss of symbiotic algae) and subsequent mortality on record.
   These events may not be attributable to local stressors or natural
   variability alone but were likely induced by nit underlying global
   phenomenon. It is probable that anthropogenic global warming has
   contributed to the extensive coral blenching that has occurred
   simultaneously throughout the reef regions of the world The geographic
   extent, increasing frequency, and regional severity of mass bleaching
   events are an apparent result of a steadily rising baseline of marine
   temperatures, combined with regionally specific El Nino and La Nina
   events. The repercussions of the 1998 mass bleaching and mortality
   events will be far-reaching. Human populations dependent on reef
   services face losses of marine biodiversity, fisheries, and shoreline
   protection. Coral bleaching events may become more frequent and severe
   as the climate continues to warm, exposing coral reefs to an
   increasingly hostile environment. This global threat to corals compounds
   the Effects of more localized anthropogenic factors that already place
   reefs at risk. Significant attention needs to be given to the monitoring
   of coral reef ecosystems, research on the projected and realized effects
   of global climate change, and measures to curtail greenhouse gas
   emissions. Even those reefs with well-enforced legal protection as
   marine sanctuaries, or those managed for sustainable use, are threatened
   by global climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Floodplain plant-herbivore-hydroperiod interactions have received little
   attention despite their potential as determinants of floodplain
   structure and functioning. We used five types of exclosures to
   differentially exclude small-, medium-, and large-sized mammals from
   accessing Fremont cottonwood (Populus deltoides Marshall subsp.
   wizlizenii (Watson) Eckenwalder) seedlings and saplings growing
   naturally on four landform types at an alluvial reach on each of two
   rivers, the Green and Yampa, in Colorado and Utah. The two study reaches
   differed primarily as a result of flow regulation on the Green River,
   which began in 1962. Landforms were a rarely hooded portion of the
   alluvial plain, geomorphically active slow- and fast-water channel
   margin sites on the Yampa reach, and an aggrading side channel on the
   Green. Small-mammal live-trapping and observational data indicated that,
   with minor exceptions, the kinds of mammals rating cottonwood within
   each reach were identical. We monitored condition and fates of
   individual cottonwood plants from October 1993 through the 1997 growing
   season. Differences in survival and growth were noted both within and
   between reaches, and both due to, and independent of, mammalian
   herbivory. Comparisons of cottonwood growth and survivorship among
   exclosures and between exclosures and controls indicated that a small
   mammal, Microtus montanus, reduced seedling and sapling survivorship at
   the Green River reach, but to a lesser extent (seedlings) or not at all
   (saplings) on the Yampa reach. In contrast, reductions in sapling height
   increment attributable to medium- and large-sized herbivores were
   detected only at the Yampa site. We suggest that these differences are a
   result of (1) flow regulation allowing Microtus populations to escape
   the mortality normally accompanying the large, snowmelt-driven spring
   flood, as well as regulation promoting a herbaceous understory favorable
   to voles, and (2) greater browsing pressure from overwintering deer and
   elk at the Yampa reach, unrelated to flow regulation. Within areas used
   by foraging beaver, the probability of a sapling being cut by beaver was
   similar on the two reaches. This study suggests that changes in riparian
   plant-herbivore relationships due to shifts in river hydrology may be a
   common and important consequence of river regulation.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of reservoir fish assemblages can provide insight
   into the development, community structure, and stability of economically
   important fisheries. A sentinel-site approach was used to assess changes
   in the offshore fish assemblage of a 36 000-ha impoundment (Lake Texoma)
   across 43 years. Fishes were sampled intensively year-round using gill
   nets in 1954, 1981-1984, and 1996-1997. Assemblage structure, overall,
   was relatively stable across years as indicated by persistence of
   species, significant concordance in rank abundance, relatively low cv of
   species abundances among years, and overlapping sample scores in
   multivariate space. However, some individual species varied in abundance
   across decades. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed six species that
   could be used to discriminate collections among decades. A more detailed
   evaluation of changes in the fish assemblage between the 1980s and the
   1990s that included size-structure and species associations showed
   little variation between decades. However, two species, small-mouth
   buffalo (Ictiobus bubalus) <400 mm in length and striped bass (Morone
   saxatilis) <250 mm in length were in greater abundance in the 1990s.
   Based on this and previous studies, the fish assemblage in Lake Texoma
   appears to be relatively stable. There is evidence to suggest: that
   populations of introduced species are more susceptible to abiotic
   disturbances than are native riverine fishes.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been proposed as a measure of
   environmental quality. The premise is that increased levels of
   environmental stress (e.g., chemical pollutants) are reflected by
   increased levels of FA within populations of organisms developing at the
   site. We test this premise by examining the relationship between stress,
   fitness, and FA among laboratory populations of house fly (Musca
   domestica L.). Exposures from 0.00 to 1.00 mu L/L of the pesticide
   ivermectin during egg-to-pupal development caused less than or equal to
   18-fold differences in levels of stress (measured as percentage
   pupation), and less than or equal to 18-fold differences in levels of
   fitness (measured as the average number of first-instar larvae produced
   by each female in the starting population) among populations. However,
   no differences were detected among population levels of FA for five wing
   traits examined. Power analyses estimated that the accuracy of the image
   analysis method used to obtain measurements would have detected a 10\%
   difference in average FA among populations 95\% of the time. Hence, the
   results of this study do not support the use of FA as a method for
   monitoring changes in environmental quality. The absence of a treatment
   effect on levels of FA may reflect the development of surviving flies in
   ``refuges,{''} thereby minimizing or avoiding their contact with
   ivermectin (the ``refuge{''} hypothesis). Alternatively, flies surviving
   exposure to ivermectin may represent a ``robust{''} subset of the
   starting population whose symmetries are relatively unaffected by the
   effects of stress (the ``differential mortality{''} hypothesis). These
   two hypotheses have received little attention in the literature, yet may
   have important implications for interpreting the effect of environmental
   stress on FA.}},

Abstract = {{Coral reef fishes occupy habitats that are patchy and subject to
   frequent natural disturbances. Although different types of disturbance
   are likely to generate different community responses, the relationship
   between different disturbance agents and their effects on reef fish
   communities has not been examined experimentally. We studied a set of
   natural patch reefs, dominated by a diverse array of soft and hard coral
   cover, at Lizard Island on the Great Barrier Reef (northeastern
   Australia). The fish assemblages on the reefs were sampled over 4 mo to
   establish baseline values and then experimentally disturbed. Two types
   of disturbance were carried out in a factorial combination: pulsed
   mortality by removing all fish from reefs and pulsed habitat
   disturbance, Habitat disturbance was applied at two levels: Level 1
   consisted only of damaging all live hard corals with a hammer; Level 2
   consisted of damaging all live hard corals, and in addition, using a
   hammer to reduce the height and complexity of the reef matrix. We then
   monitored the experiment for a further 19 mo, including two recruitment
   seasons.
   Unmanipulated control assemblages persisted through time, and despite
   large changes in total abundance, species composition remained
   consistent relative to disturbed treatments. Assemblages disturbed by
   fish removal were resilient, with recolonization from both immigration
   and larval settlement effectively removing differences between removal
   treatments and controls 3 mo after manipulation. Habitat disturbance
   alone generated differences between experimental and control
   assemblages, which persisted for the duration of the experiment. The
   more extreme level of habitat disturbance generated more extreme changes
   in fish assemblages when no pulsed mortality occurred. Habitat
   disturbance in combination with pulsed mortality generated similar
   community responses as the habitat disturbance treatment alone. However,
   fish removal had the effect of eliminating the difference between fish
   assemblages on reefs subjected to different levels of habitat
   disturbance. Community response to habitat disturbance was driven by
   species-specific patterns of reduced abundance of species associated
   with live coral in combination with increased numbers of those
   associated with rubble. Declines in the abundance of coral associates on
   damaged reefs were abrupt, with no recovery observed for the duration of
   the experiment. In contrast, increases in the abundance of rubble
   associates were more ephemeral, in that initial high levels of
   recruitment and immigration were followed by a high rate of loss.
   Habitat disturbance also generated reefs that typically supported lower
   fish abundance, fewer species, and increased evenness relative to
   controls.
   Our results support a model of patch-reef fish assemblages organized by
   a combination of deterministic factors (such as habitat structure) and
   stochastic processes (such as recruitment). These disparate mechanisms
   operate in concert to generate reasonably consistent patterns of
   community structure. Habitat structure appears to mediate much of the
   apparent determinism and is likely to operate both as a reflection of
   species-specific habitat preferences and by modifying interactions among
   fish species. Consequently, disturbance plays a substantial role in
   structuring communities of coral-reef fishes by modifying both spatial
   and temporal heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Exposure of an organism to a genotoxic chemical may result in the
   formation of covalently bound adducts between the chemical (or its
   metabolites) and the DNA; faulty repair of these adducts often results
   in mutations and, sometimes, cytogenetic changes. The primary effects of
   such exposure (i.e. adduct formation) and the subsequent effects on the
   DNA (mutation, cytogenetic damage) may be monitored using a number of
   assays of varying sensitivity and specificity. Recent developments in
   molecular biology offer new possibilities for detecting DNA damage. In
   this laboratory DNA fingerprinting by arbitrarily primed polymerase
   chain reaction (AP-PCR) was investigated in order to establish whether
   it can reveal differences in the DNA fingerprints of animals exposed to
   benzo{[}a]pyrene in the laboratory and of animals from control and from
   polluted areas. The results indicate that differences between control
   and exposed animals were detectable; these results, together with those
   from other laboratories, indicate that DNA fingerprinting by AP-PCR
   offers a useful alternative biomarker assay for the detection of the
   genotoxic effects of environmental pollutants. This paper reviews the
   application of PCR based DNA fingerprinting procedures in mutation
   detection and discusses their application to ecotoxicological studies.}},

Abstract = {{There is need for the assessment of long-term effects of outdoor air
   pollution. In fact, a considerable parr of the large amount of U.S.
   research money that has been dedicated to investigate effects of ambient
   particulate pollution should be invested to address long-term effects.
   Studies that follow the health status of large numbers of subjects
   across long periods of time (i.e., cohort studies) should be considered
   the key research approach to address these questions. However, these
   studies are time consuming and expensive. We propose efficient
   strategies to address these questions in less time. Apart from long-term
   continuation of the few ongoing air pollution cohort studies in the
   United States, data from large cohorts that were established decades ago
   may be efficiently used to assess cardiorespiratory effects and to
   target research on detection of the most susceptible subgroups in the
   population which may be related to genetic, molecular, behavioral,
   societal, and/or environmental factors. This approach will be efficient
   only if the available air pollution monitoring data will be used to
   spatially model long-term outdoor pollution concentrations across a
   given country for each year with available pollution data. Such
   concentration maps will allow researchers to impute outdoor air
   pollution levels at any residential location, independent of the
   location of monitors. Exposure imputation may be based on residential
   location(s) of participants in long-standing cardiorespiratory cohort
   studies, which can be matched to pollutant levels using geographic
   information systems. As shown in European impact assessment studies,
   such maps may be derived relatively quickly.}},

Abstract = {{One possible mechanism for the evolution of cooperation/altruism is
   assortative interactions, in which cooperators interact with each other
   by choice and cheaters are forced to interact with each other by
   default. This mechanism has been regarded as implausible in the past,
   but more recent models have revealed its likelihood when cooperative
   behaviour is a quantitative trait that can be observed directly by
   members of the population. Assortative interactions are likely to occur
   in guppies (Poecilia reticulata) because they cooperate in the context
   of predator inspection, their inspection behaviour is a quantitative
   trait, and they are known to monitor each other's behaviour and choose
   to associate with fish that inspect. Despite these preconditions, our
   experiments failed to demonstrate assortative interactions in
   free-swimming guppies. We offer our negative evidence as an incentive
   for others to look for what remains a theoretically plausible mechanism
   for the evolution of cooperation/altruism.}},

Abstract = {{when monitoring endangered species, natural resource managers require a
   recovery benchmark and a statistical procedure to test whether the
   benchmark has been met. We applied statistical power analysis to devise
   such a procedure for the endangered Sacramento River winter chinook
   salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Winter chinook salmon management
   currently focuses on population growth rate, and our procedure used a
   Student's t-test to evaluate whether the average population growth rate
   is significantly lower than the management goal of 0.57 per generation.
   In the test, the null hypothesis was that the growth rate was not lower
   than the desired rate. In contrast to the usual hypothesis-testing
   framework, our procedure did not control for the type-I error rate.
   Instead, it controlled for the statistical power (the complement of the
   type-II error rate) and uses the resulting type-I error rate, computed
   from the sample size and other information, for the test. This procedure
   is conservative for winter chinook salmon in that, if all assumptions
   are met, it provides the specified level of assurance of detecting
   dangerously low population growth rates.}},

Abstract = {{1. The role of seasonal phenology in the emergence of zooplankton from
   diapause in patterns of seasonal abundance in the water column was
   investigated in Oneida Lake, New York. Replicate emergence traps, placed
   in contact with the lake sediments at two locations (one at a shallow
   site and one at a deep site), were monitored between May and August.
   2. Although six rotifer taxa showed a clear seasonal succession in the
   water column throughout the study period, all but one taxon emerged
   exclusively in spring. Three cladoceran and three calanoid copepod
   species, also present in the water column throughout the study period,
   again showed predominantly spring emergence. In contrast, three
   cyclopoid copepod species had distinct seasonal periods of emergence
   that corresponded, at least in part, to the timing of abundance peaks in
   the plankton.
   3. These results for a single lake are largely consistent with patterns
   observed or inferred by other investigators for other lakes: variable
   dependence of abundance in the plankton on diapause emergence for
   species with long-lived diapausing eggs (i.e. rotifers, cladocerans and
   calanoid copepods), and much closer dependence for species with
   short-lived diapausing immature stages (i.e. cyclopoid copepods).}},

   after the Chernobyl accident - Report 2. Ingestion doses of the rural

Abstract = {{Doses from the ingestion of Cs-134 and Cs-137 during 12 y following the
   Chernobyl accident have been estimated for approximately 3 million
   persons living in rural areas of the Zhitomir, Rivne, and Kyiv Oblasts
   of northern Ukraine. This assessment is based upon an extensive
   monitoring campaign that provided measurements of Cs-137 in more than
   120,000 samples of milk and in more than 100,000 persons; such
   measurements were made in approximately 4,500 locations. Two approaches
   were used for the dose assessment. In the first approach a so-called
   reference dose is estimated for each settlement on the basis of measured
   Cs-137 concentration in milk, determination of the milk equivalent of
   diet, and consumption rates; a further assumption is that a high
   fraction of the food consumed is produced locally. The reference dose is
   used as the official dose estimate, which is the basis for any decision
   on possible financial compensation and economic privileges. In a second
   step, the so-called real age-dependent dose is estimated from the
   results of whole body counter measurements and the kinetics of
   radiocesium in the human body. Real doses above 0.5, 5, and 50 mSv were
   received by about 40\%, 10\%, and 0.2\%, respectively, of the considered
   population. With the exception of 1986, for which the monitoring results
   were limited, the real individual doses derived from whole-body counting
   are consistently lower than the reference doses. However, this
   difference declined from a factor of 3-4 in 1987-1989 to a factor of
   approximately 1.5 in the mid 1990's. The difference between reference
   and real doses is attributed to the effectiveness of countermeasures
   implemented after the accident. The effectiveness of these
   countermeasures decreased with time due to increasing economic problems
   in Ukraine. The collective reference and real doses of the rural
   population due to the intake of Cs-134 and Cs-137 are estimated to be
   13,300 and 5,300 person-Sv, respectively. Thus, about 8,000 person-Sv is
   estimated to have been averted by countermeasures.}},

Abstract = {{Among- and within-population variation at neutral loci is governed by an
   interaction between stochastic processes and gene flow. A previous study
   of pollen dispersal in which the transfer of individually marked
   pollinia was monitored, indicated not only that populations of the
   nonrewarding, bumblebee-pollinated orchid Calypso bulbosa are connected
   by substantial levels of gene flow, but also that seed production may be
   the result of self-fertilization to a considerable extent. We examined
   the genetic structure of 21 C. bulbosa populations in northern Sweden by
   F-statistics analyses of variation at three polymorphic allozyme loci.
   Four populations each consisted of two or three distinct patches, which
   also allowed us to evaluate among-patch differentiation. The inbreeding
   coefficient over all loci within populations was high (F-IS=0.283).
   F-statistics indicated that the level of genetic differentiation among
   patches within populations varied among populations. F-ST among patches
   within populations ranged between -0.021 and 0.119 and was significantly
   different from zero in two of the populations. There was low to moderate
   genetic differentiation among populations (F-ST=0.072). A Mantel test
   indicated a positive correlation between geographical and genetic
   distances among populations, but this correlation was dependent on the
   difference in allele frequencies between the southernmost population
   sampled and all other populations. Self-fertilization and substructuring
   within sampling units (within patches and populations) may have
   contributed to the high inbreeding coefficients observed in many C.
   bulbosa populations. Long-distance seed and pollen dispersal may account
   for the low to moderate genetic differentiation among populations.}},

Abstract = {{A modification of the Habitat Evaluation Procedure (USFWS, 1976) applied
   to crested newt habitats is described, using ten key habitat criteria,
   based upon the assumption that habitat quality determines population
   size. Seven of these criteria (pond area, permanence, shading and
   density, macrophyte density, number of waterfowl and terrestrial habitat
   quality) are assessed using objective habitat measurements, the other
   three (site geography, water quality and fish occurrence) using
   qualitative rule-bases, to produce a Habitat Suitability Index for each
   site. Preliminary validation of the method for a set of 72 sites
   provides a significant rank correlation between indices of population
   size and of habitat. The procedure has the potential to provide a simple
   method of habitat assessment, for site surveying or selection of host
   sites for translocation, and can be upgraded easily as knowledge of
   crested newt habitat requirements improves. There was an incidental
   indication from the validation exercise that the number of newts caught
   by bottle trapping was affected negatively by the presence of
   macrophytes.}},

   agricultural landscape of the Drachenfelser Landchen, south-west of
   Bonn, Germany. Seven ponds - three natural and four man-made-were
   monitored by drift fences and pitfall traps. The numbers of adults
   increased from 1992. The number of juvenile emigrants showed marked
   fluctuations between years at all ponds and in some years juvenile
   production failed completely at the temporary ponds. A total of 63\% of
   the adult newts identified in 1994 at four sites were recaptured in the
   subsequent year. Ninety-nine percent of the newts recaptured returned to
   the place of the first capture. In contrast to the adults, a number of
   juvenile great crested newts moved to neighbouring ponds, migrating a
   maximum distance of 860 m within the year of metamorphosis. Two out of
   four artificially constructed ponds were colonized naturally.}},

Abstract = {{Published evidence from 178 great crested newt population translocations
   in the UK carried out between 1985 and 1994 emphasizes the need for
   continued monitoring following translocation. In more than half the
   cases, there was insufficient evidence for judging success, mainly due
   to lack of monitoring. Using the liberal criterion of the presence of a
   population one-year following translocation, 37\% of all cases were
   successful and 10\% unsuccessful. Most of the failures were predictable
   from existing knowledge of great crested newt requirements. Conflict
   between development objectives and great crested newt conservation at a
   site in northern England prompted a large-scale translocation of over
   1000 individually photographed adults to a conservation area immediately
   adjacent to the development site. During the first year following
   translocation, adult newts showed a strong tendency to move towards
   their previous breeding site, some travelling 500 m in doing so, but
   none reaching home ponds 900 m away. At least 60\% of the translocated
   newt population either escaped from - or attempted to leave - the
   conservation area. The remainder accepted the ponds in the conservation
   area, some of which were less than one year old, and bred successfully.
   Population sizes were extrapolated from the results of trapping both
   outside and within the conservation area. The estimated density of
   adults in the conservation area, at 150 ha(-1), was high compared to
   that in the proposed development site (about 5 ha(-1)). Nevertheless, in
   the first year the population in the conservation area showed good
   production of metamorphs, and mortality consistent with that found in
   previous studies. Furthermore, most recaptured adults had grown (median
   of 18\% gain in mass) during the season. This was probably the result of
   the increased habitat diversity in the conservation area, especially the
   aquatic habitat. It must be recognised that this translocation procedure
   can be applied only to the adult component of the population.}},

Abstract = {{Maerl beds are mixed sediments built by a surface layer of slow-growing,
   unattached coralline algae that are of international conservation
   significance because they create areas of high biodiversity. They are
   patchily distributed throughout Europe (to similar to 30 m depth around
   the British Isles and to similar to 120 m depth in the Mediterranean)
   and many are affected by towed demersal fishing. We report the effects
   of Newhaven scallop dredges on a previously unfished maerl bed compared
   with the effects on similar grounds that have been fished commercially
   in the Clyde Sea area; Scotland. Sediment cores were taken to assess the
   population density of live maerl thalli prior to scallop dredging on
   marked test and control plots. These plots were then monitored
   biannually over a four-year period. Live maerl thalli were sparsely
   distributed at the impacted site, and experimental dredging had no
   discernible effect on their numbers. The previously unfished ground had
   dense populations of live maerl and scallops (both Aequipecten
   opercularis and Pecten maximus). While counts of live maerl remained
   high on the control plot, scallop dredging led to a >70\% reduction with
   no sign of recovery over the subsequent four years. The vulnerability of
   maerl and associated benthos (e.g., the delicate bivalve, Limaria hians)
   is discussed in relation to towed demersal fishing practices. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Studies were conducted at the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station
   research farms located at Munday (1996 test) and Chillicothe (1997 test)
   to evaluate relay strip crops in combination with a food spray to
   enhance biological control of bollworms, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and
   cotton aphids, Aphis gossypii Glover, in cotton. The relay crops
   included fall plantings of hairy vetch, Vicia villosa Roth, and canola,
   Brassica napus L., and a spring planting of grain sorghum, Sorghum
   bicolor L. Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., was planted between the relay
   crops or was isolated from the relay crops. Treatments within the two
   cotton systems included an untreated check plot, a plot sprayed with
   sugar+yeast (food spray) during summer to attract and hold predator
   insects, a plot sprayed with biological (`soft') insecticides for
   bollworm and cotton aphid control (Bacillus thuringiensis and
   pymetrozine, respectively), and a plot sprayed with harsh insecticides
   for bollworm and cotton aphid control (zeta cypermethrin and dicrotophos
   or profonofos, respectively). A split-plot experimental design, with
   three replications, was used where whole plots included relay and
   isolated cotton systems and subplots were the four food/chemical
   treatments. Predator numbers were monitored with a vacuum sampler once a
   week in relay crops and cotton. Bollworms and cotton aphids were
   monitored visually once a week in cotton during July and August. Total
   predator numbers were higher in cotton adjacent to relay crops in 1996,
   but not in 1997. The food spray did not enhance attraction and retention
   of predators either year. Bollworm larval numbers were significantly
   higher in relay cotton, food spray plots in 1996. Bollworm larval
   numbers were similar in relay and isolated cotton, and larval numbers
   were significantly reduced only in the plot where zeta cypermethrin
   (harsh insecticide plot) was used. In 1996, cotton aphid numbers in the
   relay cotton system were significantly higher in the untreated check
   plots in relation to numbers in the food spray, soft insecticide, and
   harsh insecticide plots, which were statistically similar. In the
   isolated cotton system, aphid numbers were highest in untreated plots,
   intermediate in food spray and soft insecticide plots, and lowest in the
   harsh insecticide plots. Aphid numbers increased more rapidly in the
   harsh insecticide plots that had been treated previously for bollworm
   control. The food spray and pymetrozine treatments reduced cotton aphids
   more effectively in the relay cropping system than in the isolated
   cotton system. Bollworms and cotton aphids did not reach pest status in
   1997. The combination of a relay cropping system with a food spray did
   not enhance predator numbers and did not aid in retention of predators
   in cotton during August. Sucrose in the food spray attracted high
   numbers of bollworms in 1996.}},

Abstract = {{1. Information is lacking on how possible future changes in the seasonal
   occurrence and intensity of precipitation in Europe will affect the
   arthropod community of arable farmland.
   2. We used a novel experimental approach to investigate the responses of
   farmland arthropods to spring precipitation in a spring-sown legume.
   Replicated plots were subjected to spring drought (plots shielded from
   rainfall), actual rainfall (reference) and spring irrigation. Shielding
   plots extended an existing drought to 58 days.
   3. The response of epigeic arthropods was investigated using principal
   components analysis (PCA) and principal response curves (PRC). Temporal
   changes in treatment effects at the community level were more clearly
   displayed by PRC than by PCA, while PRC improved the interpretation of
   individual species' responses. PRC analysis has potential for wider
   application in ecological experiments and monitoring.
   4. Short-term manipulation of precipitation in May affected the
   arthropod community for at least 97 days, despite exceptionally high
   rainfall in June. The effects of drought on the abundance of herbivores,
   mycophages, omnivores and predators were negative, while those of
   irrigation were positive. There were no differences in the responses of
   beneficial and pest taxa.
   5. In addition to their intrinsic importance, these findings illustrate
   that spring weather might affect the availability of arthropod prey for
   insectivorous wildlife. Food availability has been implicated in the
   population declines of several insectivorous farmland birds.
   6. The difficulty of manipulating rainfall in a temperate climate
   precludes realistic field studies of how farmland arthropods respond to
   precipitation. We suggest that automated rain shielding of experimental
   plots provides a technique for wider application in drought studies.}},

Abstract = {{The fungus, Aspergillus niger var. phoenicis effects the seeds of the
   Namibian endemic plant, Welwitschia mirabilis. In recent years, the
   increased spread of this fungus has raised concerns regarding the
   survival of this unique plant because of its perceived detrimental
   effect on seed germination and recruitment. Field studies conducted in
   different geographic areas of Namibia, namely at the Kuiseb River,
   Welwitschia Plains, Brandberg, Springbukwasser, Petrified Forest and
   Kaokoveld, in June/July 1998, showed clear regional patterns in the
   level of fungal infection. Fungal infection was significantly higher in
   the Brandberg area and lower at Welwitschia Plains. Autocorrelation
   spatial analyses suggest that the occurrence of the fungal disease is
   clustered. This supports previous evidence that Probergrothius
   sexpunctatis (Heteroptera) is an important insect vector in disease
   transmission. The data provides a baseline against which to monitor
   changes in the fungal infection in future years.

Abstract = {{1 Salt marshes in south-west Spain are being invaded by Spartina
   densiflora, a South American introduction, although the native S.
   maritima still dominates many lower marshes. A transplant experiment was
   used to investigate the means by which physical and chemical factors may
   determine lower vegetation limits in the tidal frame. Both species were
   transplanted from a mid-level marsh to lower, unvegetated tidal flats.
   2 The survival and growth of transplanted clumps and their constituent
   tillers were monitored on an elevational gradient. The photosynthetic
   competence of transplants was assessed by measurements of leaf gas
   exchange and the fast kinetics of chlorophyll fluorescence. Submergence
   period, salinity, redox potential and sulphide concentration in the
   sediment were also examined at the transplant sites.
   3 Neither species survived for a year at the lowest transplant point (+
   1.04 m relative to Spanish Hydrographic Zero). At + 1.41 m elevation, S.
   maritima survived well but all clumps of S. densiflora died. At higher
   elevations (+ 1.46-1.67 m), clumps of both species had high survival
   rates. Tiller growth rates in surviving clumps of both species increased
   with elevation, but that of S. densiflora was more sensitive to low
   elevation.
   4 S. maritima showed no impairment of photosynthetic performance, even
   at the lowest elevation; its rates of gas exchange were independent of
   elevation, as were its chlorophyll fluorescence parameters. In contrast,
   in S. densiflora the rate of CO2 uptake declined and stress to
   photosystem II (Fv/Fp) increased at lower elevations; both of these
   photosynthetic measurements were linearly related to sediment redox
   potential. Stomatal conductance did not vary with elevation.
   5 S. maritima has a potentially wide elevational tolerance and an
   absolute lower limit substantially below that of S. densiflora. The
   progressively reduced growth and survival of S. densiflora at lower
   levels appear to result primarily from impairment of photosynthesis when
   root conditions are hypoxic. This effect is mediated through effects on
   the photochemical apparatus rather than on stomatal resistance to CO2
   uptake.
   6 These studies define lower limits to the fundamental niches of the two
   species in a Mediterranean-type salt marsh and thus provide a basis for
   future investigations of interactions between them. The correlation
   between chlorophyll fluorescence and long-term survival of S. densiflora
   suggests that this short-term measure may be a valuable tool.}},

Abstract = {{Colonies of Reticulitermes spp. were baited with prototype and
   commercial Sentricon stations (Dow AgroSciences LLC, Indianapolis, IN)
   to test the efficacy of hexaflumuron in different concentrations and
   bait matrices and to document reinvasion of the foraging territories
   vacated by eliminated colonies. Seven colonies of Reticulitermes spp.
   from two sites were characterized with cuticular hydrocarbon analyses
   and mark-release-recapture and agonistic behavioral studies. Three
   colonies were observed as controls and four colonies were baited. When a
   connection between the bait station and the monitoring station could not
   be confirmed by mark-release-recapture studies, the results of the
   baiting were equivocal. The monitoring stations of a colony at our
   wildland site were devoid of termites 406 d after baiting with one
   Sentricon station, but became reoccupied with the same species of
   termites approximate to 6 mo after baiting. A colony at the residential
   site was baited with 0.5\% hexaflumuron in the Recurit II bait matrix;
   60 d later termites were absent from all monitoring stations. These
   monitoring stations remained unoccupied for greater than or equal to 18
   mo. Foraging Reticulitermes spp appeared in three of the seven
   monitoring stations 18, 23, and 36 mo after baiting, respectively. Using
   cuticular hydrocarbon analyses and agonistic behavior studies, we
   determined that the Reticulitermes spp. occupying these monitoring
   stations were from three different colonies; none were members of the
   original colony destroyed by baiting. Another colony at the residential
   site was baited using a noncommercial, experimental bait; 52 d later
   termites were absent from all monitoring stations. The monitoring
   stations remained unoccupied for greater than or equal to 9 mo. A
   different Reticulitermes sp, colony invaded one monitoring station 9 mo
   after baiting.}},

Abstract = {{Stored-product insects are a perennial problem in retail stores, where
   they damage and contaminate susceptible merchandise such as food
   products and animal feed. Historically, pest management in these stores
   has relied heavily on chemical insecticides, but environmental and
   health issues have dictated use of safer methods, and these require
   better monitoring. A monitoring procedure that employs an array of moth
   and beetle traps combined with spatial (contour) analysis of trap catch
   was tested in three department stores and two pet stores. The rate of
   capture increased with the level of infestation but was essentially
   constant over 4- to 5-d trapping periods. Contour analysis effectively
   located foci of infestation and reflected population changes produced by
   applications of the insect growth regulator (S)-hydroprene. The most
   abundant insects were Plodia interpunctella (Hubner), Lasioderma
   serricorne (F.), Oryzaephilus mercator (Fauvel), Tribolium castaneum
   (Herbst),and Cryptolestes pusillus (Schonherr). The results indicate
   that contour analysis of trap counts provides a useful monitoring tool
   for management of storage pests in retail stores. It identifies trouble
   spots and permits selection, timing, and precision targeting of control
   measures to achieve maximum pest suppression with minimum pesticide
   risk. It permits managers and pest control operators to visualize pest
   problems over an entire store, to monitor changes over time, and to
   evaluate the effectiveness of control intervention. The contour maps
   themselves, along with records of control applications and stock
   rotation, provide permanent documentation of pest problems and the
   effectiveness of pest management procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The larkspur mirid, Hoplomachus affiguratus Uhler, has been proposed as
   a biological control agent to damage tail larkspur, Delphinium
   barbeyi(L.) Huth, to prevent cattle from grazing it and becoming
   poisoned. The objective of this study was to monitor mirid populations
   and feeding damage to larkspur over time and determine if its population
   cycles are related to specific weather patterns. Individual larkspur
   plants were marked and the extent of damage estimated at 5 locations on
   3 National Forests in Utah and Colorado. In years when mirid populations
   were high, damage to larkspur leaves ranged from 50 to 100\% and greater
   than 75\% of flowering heads aborted. In years and locations when its
   population was down, damage was minimal. The amount of larkspur damage
   was negatively correlated with the previous year's total precipitation
   and the previous September precipitation (r = -0.68 to -83) and was
   positively correlated with July and August temperature the previous year
   (r = 0.61 to 0.75). When mirid populations are high, damage levels
   appear to be sufficient to deter cattle grazing, but low levels of
   damage at the bottom of the cycle will likely not deter grazing.}},

Title = {{The reproductive cycle of the sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{80}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The sea urchin Psammechinus miliaris was sampled at monthly intervals
   from two replicate sites at contrasting locations (littoral and subtidal
   habitats) on the west coast of Scotland. Samples were collected from
   November 1995 to October 1997. A study of gonad development showed a
   clearly defined annual cycle of gametogenesis with a single spawning
   period. Gonad indices (GIs) varied between locations, between sites at
   the same location and between study years. Gonad indices were maximal
   prior to the onset of the spawning period in June and July. Ripe gametes
   were shed by dissected urchins from June to September in 1996 and June
   to August in 1997 coinciding with the time of year when the gonad colour
   was best in terms of what is desired in the marketplace. Over winter the
   GIs were very low and gonads became very dark in colour. Higher summer
   GIs in the urchins from one littoral site suggested that the urchins
   there had a seasonal influx of a more nutritious or more abundant food
   resource. Histological determination of the reproductive state showed
   that for these food-limited populations high GIs do equate with the
   spawning period. The gametogenic cycle fits the six stage pattern
   described for other echinoid species. In females oocytes of various
   developmental stages were present throughout the annual cycle.
   Recruitment to the littoral location was monitored over two seasons by
   quantifying the number of urchins with a test diameter <5 mm appearing
   in the population. Recruitment appeared variable between sites and
   between seasons suggesting that the collection of juveniles resulting
   from natural settlement may not be a reliable alternative to hatchery
   produced spat. Although P miliaris has commercial potential when in
   cultivation, this study provided no evidence of an opportunity for a
   commercial fishery.}},

Abstract = {{Common snipe (Gallinago gallinago delicata) harvest surveys and banding
   programs have been hampered by the inability to externally distinguish
   between age and sex cohorts. We measured 11 skeletal and 34 plumage
   characteristics on 152 male and 220 female snipe that had been
   internally sexed. We also compared coloration of plumage and soft parts
   between 131 hatch-year (HY) and 93 after-hatch-year (AHY) snipe that
   were aged internally using presence or absence of the bursa of
   Fabricius. Using discriminant analysis of morphological characteristics,
   we developed 5 discriminant models to sex common snipe. Discriminant
   equations for sexing common snipe contained 1-4 variables and were
   tested using cross-validation (i.e., jacknifing) and an independent
   sample of 99 birds. Common snipe could be correctly sexed 73-91\% of the
   time, depending on the model. To facilitate a parts-collection survey to
   determine sex ratio in the harvest, we derived 3 discriminant models
   using strictly feather measurements. After-hatch-year and HY common
   snipe showed no consistent differences in plumage and soft part
   coloration. However, once snipe were sexed, they could be aged using 1
   of 4 discriminant functions that aged snipe with 77.5-84.1\% accuracy
   These aging and sexing techniques will be useful in monitoring snipe
   populations, establishing harvest surveys, and conducting future
   research on common snipe.}},

Abstract = {{Concern over the status of species associated with prairie dog colonies
   has increased with the recent proposed listing of black-tailed prairie
   dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). We monitored burrowing owl (Athene
   cunicularia) populations and prairie dog densities in 17 black-tailed
   prairie dog colonies in the Nebraska panhandle between 1990 and 1996.
   All prairie dog colonies were controlled at least once during the study.
   We observed a 63\% decline in nesting pairs of burrowing owls and
   significant declines in burrow densities. Results indicated a time lag
   in owl response to changes in active burrow densities. However, in the
   later years of the study when burrow densities were lowest, owl numbers
   were positively correlated with the density of active burrows in the
   same years, indicating active burrows may become more important as
   burrow density declines. We also monitored fledging success of burrowing
   owls for 398 nesting attempts over 5 years (1989-93) for a larger set of
   colonies that included the 17 used in the owl and prairie dog
   monitoring. Differences in mean fledging success among colonies each
   year (colony effect) explained most of the variation in fledging success
   among nesting owls. Vulnerability to badger (Taxidea taxus) predation
   may in part explain differences in fledging success among colonies;
   badger predation on owl nests was lower when densities of active prairie
   dog burrows were high. Efforts are needed to ensure preservation of
   black-tailed prairie dog colonies for burrowing owls and other species
   associated with this prairie ecosystem, and to better monitor changes in
   burrowing owl and prairie dog populations.}},

Abstract = {{Sleepy lizards Tiliqua rugosa are large, long-lived, Australian skinks
   that live in stable home ranges. Previous studies showed that the
   lizards have a good sense of orientation and navigation towards home.
   However, since they are active only 4 months in every year, there is a
   question about which environmental cues enable them to locate their home
   boundaries. In the present study we determined whether surrounding
   olfactory and chemical cues are important for the sleepy lizards for
   home-range maintenance. In the first part of the study we showed in the
   laboratory that zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) is a chemical that induces anosmia
   and prevents detection of chemical cues in sleepy lizards for up to 30
   days, with no evident longterm harm to the animals. We then monitored
   the location of 50 radio-tagged sleepy lizards. After determining their
   home ranges they were divided into three groups: an untreated control, a
   saline-treated (sham-operated) group and a ZnSO4-treated group. Starting
   2 days after the treatment, the home ranges of all lizards were
   re-determined within the period that ZnSO4 blocked olfaction. Three
   variables were calculated comparing home ranges before and after
   treatments: the change in home-range size, the distance between the
   centre of activities of the lizards, and the overlap between the
   individual home ranges before and after treatments. Lizard home ranges
   varied from 1.9 +/- 0.6 ha to 4.6 +/- 1.4 ha before treatment, and 1.3
   +/- 0.3 ha to 3.1 +/- 0.7 ha after treatment. There was no significant
   effect of treatments or of sex on the home-range size or on the
   distances between the centre of activities, or on the overlap between
   the individual home ranges. Our data indicate that olfaction and
   vomerolfaction are not a major cue for home-range maintenance in the
   sleepy lizards.}},

Abstract = {{The energetics and burrowing behaviour of the semifossorial Octodon
   degus (Rodentia: Octodontidae) were investigated and compared with that
   of more specialized fossorial rodents. An open-flow respirometry system
   was used to record energy expenditure of single degus inside
   respirometers partially filled with soft (moist) or hard (dry) soil. In
   addition, digging behaviour was recorded in groups of three animals
   inside a large terrarium under controlled conditions of food,
   photoperiod and temperature. In the field, the digging activity of degus
   was monitored, along with seasonal variations in rainfall, content of
   soil moisture and soil hardness. Mass-specific metabolic rate during
   digging was found to be higher in animals burrowing in soft soils
   compared to hard soil. However, animals burrowing in soft soil removed
   more soil per min than animals in hard soil. Thus, gram per gram,
   excavating in hard soil was energetically more expensive. The digging
   cost of semifossorial degus tends to be either similar to or above those
   of similarly sized, but more fossorial, rodents. In the field,
   heightened digging activity coincided with the occurrence of rainfall,
   greater content of soil moisture and relatively soft soil conditions.
   Degus generally use their front feet and teeth to sheer the soil;
   disposal of accumulated debris being carried out by moving their front
   and hind feet backwards. We also observed the establishment of digging
   chains when two or three individuals burrowed at the same site. As far
   as digging is concerned, the behaviour of degus is similar to that of
   other fossorial rodents, such as African bathyergids and the more
   closely related South American ctenomyids.}},

   abundance in enclosed and open plots in adjacent burned and unburned
   units within two remnant Illinois prairies. Vacuum sampling of
   arthropods at semimonthly intervals following spring burns at each site
   indicated that fire strongly depressed arthropod abundance initially,
   but that abundance and species richness tended to recover toward the end
   of the summer, mostly due to recolonization from adjacent unburned
   refuges. Nevertheless, arthropod groups (taxa or guilds) were affected
   differently by fire, and differences in arthropod species composition
   among burned and unburned plots persisted. Sampled arthropod groups
   significantly reduced by fire at one or both study sites included
   springtails (Collembola), deltocephaline leafhoppers (Homoptera:
   Cicadellidae: Deltocephalinae), aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae), delphacid
   planthoppers (Homoptera: Delphacidae), parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera),
   and spiders (Araneae). Only one group, typhlocybine leafhoppers
   (Homoptera: Cicadellidae: Typhlocybinae), exhibited a significant
   positive response to fire. These results indicate that in situ
   populations of many arthropod species are substantially reduced by
   prescribed fire. Thus, to preserve native arthropod faunas, land
   managers should ensure that unburned refuges are maintained and that the
   intervals between burns are sufficient to allow recolonization of burned
   areas to occur.}},

Abstract = {{The North Cascades Ecosystem of Washington (USA) and British Columbia
   (Canada) still supports a community of large mammalian carnivores,
   although some species may be seriously threatened with extirpation. This
   paper provides a summary of information on the numbers of grizzly bear
   (Ursus arctos Merriam), gray wolf (Canis lupus Hall and Kelson),
   Canadian lynx (Lynx canadensis Kurten and Rausch), and wolverine (Gulo
   gulo Kurten and Rausch), and an overview of current conservation efforts
   in the North Cascades Ecosystem. Basic research on population status,
   distribution, habitat needs, and limiting factors is needed for many of
   these species, because limited field investigations have been conducted
   in the region. It may be appropriate to approach some research tasks,
   such as basic surveys and evaluation of habitat connectivity, using a
   multi-species approach. In addition, a multi-species approach may be
   appropriate to address conservation issues such as monitoring, human
   access, and prey species management. By raising the awareness of
   managers, scientists, and the public about these issues, we hope to
   recognize the opportunity to recover a full complement of native
   carnivores and a functioning ecosystem in the North Cascades Ecosystem.
   This is an opportunity that is becoming extremely limited on a global
   scale.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the application of a new group of molecular markers,
   microsatellite loci, to monitor genetic diversity in stocks used in fish
   enhancement programs. To illustrate the potential use of these markers,
   we examined the genetic variation associated with the Connecticut River
   and Penobscot River populations of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar in the
   United States. Both rivers are stocked annually with fry from captive or
   cultured stocks that are one generation removed from sea-run adults. We
   analyzed microsatellite loci variation among sea-run adults and the
   derived cultured stock for the Connecticut River in a given year, along
   with two consecutive cohorts of cultured age-0 juveniles for the
   Penobscot River. Our results reveal subtle differences in allele
   frequencies between the two samples for each stock and some potential
   increases of homozygotes. These results demonstrate the potential value
   of microsatellite loci for routine genetic monitoring of cultured
   Atlantic salmon populations associated with restoration programs in the
   eastern United States.}},

Abstract = {{Biorational and regular insecticide applications were evaluated for
   management of the diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella in cabbage
   (Brassica oleracea var capitata) in Karnataka State, India, in 1996 and
   1997. The IPM programme, based on the pheromone trap catch threshold of
   eight moths per trap per night, included utilization of the parasitoid
   Cotesia plutellae. (250000 adults ha(-1)), the predator Chrysoperla
   carnea (2500 eggs ha(-1)), the neem-based chemical nimbecidine (625ml
   ha(-1)), the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (500 ml ha(-1)), and the
   synthetic insecticide phosalone (2.8 litre ha(-1)). The IPM programme
   induced a reduction of trap catches, egg and larval populations and,
   therefore, a low level of damage to the crop. The economic analysis
   showed that the cost of the IPM treatments was also considerably lower
   than that of ordinary insecticide practice (average of \$61 relative to
   \$123 ha(-1), respectively). Gross profit was also clearly higher in IPM
   plots than in farmer's fields, ranging from \$777 to \$810 ha(-1) in the
   IPM plots compared with \$456 to \$462 ha(-1) in the insecticide-treated
   fields. As a consequence of lower input costs and higher gross profit,
   net profit in IPM treatments was even more favourable, and the economic
   savings associated with the utilization of the IPM programme amounted to
   \$380 ha(-1) in 1996 and \$410 ha(-1) in 1997. (C) 2000 Society of

Abstract = {{Population densities of Belonolaimus longicaudatus were monitored at
   monthly intervals at the Tamarisk country club golf course (1993 to
   1994) and at the Annenburg Estates and Desert Island golf courses
   (1998). All three courses are located at Rancho Mirage, Coachella
   Valley, CA. The bermuda grass in the sampling area typically exhibited
   chlorosis at the beginning of April when the sting nematode populations
   began to increase. At the Tamarisk golf course, population density
   peaked in October, with 1.000 nematodes per 100 cm(3) of soil, but
   declined rapidly, with the lowest population density occurring in
   December with approximately 50 nematodes per 100 cm3 of soil. At the
   Annenburg Estates and Desert Island golf courses, the nematode
   population densities peaked in June and July but declined rapidly to
   less than half of that density, presumably because of B.
   longicaudatus-caused host decline. Soil temperature and fluctuation of
   nematode densities were significantly correlated at all locations.
   Nematode distribution was greatest in the top 15 cm of soil except
   during the hottest summer months, when the population was higher at
   depths of 15 to 30 cm.}},

Abstract = {{A seven-year study of marked plants and plots in Stipagrostis ciliata
   (Desf.) de Winter dune grassland, in the arid (< 100 mm yr(-1))
   Bushmanland area of the Northern Cape province of South Africa, was
   designed to test the hypothesis that establishment of ephemeral plants,
   and recruitment of perennial grasses was dependent upon disturbances
   that reduced the density of living perennial grass tussocks. In 1989,
   eight 4 m(2) plots were cleared of perennial vegetation by uprooting and
   removing all plants so as to resemble small-scale disturbances made by
   burrowing mammals or territorial antelope. The vegetation on the cleared
   plots and surroundings was monitored until 1996. Initial results
   supported our hypothesis. In wet years, when ephemeral plants were
   abundant, their average fresh mass was 2-3 times greater per unit area
   on the cleared plots than in control plots in adjacent, undisturbed
   grassland. Many Stipagrostis seedlings established in the cleared plots
   over the two years following clearing but were rare in adjacent areas
   among established conspecifics. However, a drought in 1992 (11 mm of
   rain over 12 months) lead to widespread mortality of the perennial
   grass, killing 56\% (range 22-79\%) of established tufts. High densities
   of Stipagrostis seedlings appeared following the drought-breaking rains
   in January 1993, both in the disturbed plots and in the surrounding
   `undisturbed' dune grassland. Ephemeral plants established in large
   numbers throughout the area during the high rainfall year of 1996 and
   were generally more numerous in the old disturbances than in control
   plots. Seven years after clearing the biomass of grass on the cleared
   plots was approximately 34\% of the mass removed from the plots in 1989
   whereas in the undisturbed grassland biomass was 66\% of 1989 levels.
   Drought had little long-term effect on community composition, and
   Stipagrostis ciliata constituted 94-98\% of plant community before and
   after drought. Cleared plots were recolonised by S. ciliata, but the
   contribution of other grass species increased by 6-9\%. Synchronous
   recruitment following occasional drought-induced mortality can generate
   even-aged populations of the dominant desert dune grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Previous study showed that co-composting sewage sludge with lime would
   effectively reduce the availability of heavy metals in the sludge
   compost. In the present study, effects of addition of lime on the
   microbial activities of sewage sludge composting were evaluated in a
   bench-scale in-vessel system through monitoring biological parameters
   including microbial respiration, microbial populations (thermophile and
   mesophile), and activities of related enzyme (dehydrogenase, alkaline
   phosphatase, beta-glucosidase, and urease). Lime raised the pH of the
   sludge compost effectively at the initial period, and this effect became
   less obvious with an increase in composting time. Adverse effects of
   lime amendment on all biological parameters increased with an increase
   in lime application rates, but these effects were generally restricted
   to the early stage of the thermophilic phase. Addition of 0.63\% lime
   prior to sludge composting slightly improved the microbial activity as
   indicated by the higher temperature and CO, evolution and did not exert
   a significant inhibition on bacterial population, and the activities of
   beta- glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, and dehydrogenase after 100
   days of composting. This together with our previous results on heavy
   metal availability supports the use of lime at a rate of <1.0\% (w/w) to
   co-compost with sewage sludge. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The Plumbeus Vireo (Vireo plumbeus) is a poorly studied songbird species
   that breeds within the interior western United States and Mexico. We
   studied the breeding behavior of Plumbeous Vireos within pinylon-juniper
   habitats in northeastern New Mexico in 1996 and 1997. Over both years we
   located and monitored 40 nests and conducted behavioral observations
   throughout the nesting cycle. From these observations we described and
   compared basic behavioral traits of male and female vireos during their
   nest-building egg-laying, incubation, and nestling stages, and their
   response to potential predators near the nest. Male vireos displayed
   potential nest sites: to females, but the females selected the site to
   be used and built most of the nest. Vireos often did not initiate
   egg-laying until 2-3 d after nest completion. The female tended to
   incubate eggs and brood nestlings more than the male, but both parents
   contributed equally in provisioning the young. Brown-headed Cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) parasitized 77\% of nests in 1906, 63\% in 1997, and
   parasitism was the primary cause of nest failure in this population. The
   conspicuousness of vireos around the nest, particularly during the
   nest-building stage, may contribute to high parasitism levels. Vireo
   aggression near die nest may also act as a cue to help cowbirds locate
   nests.}},

Abstract = {{Several species of raptors winter at Rocky Mountain Arsenal National
   Wildlife Refuge (Refuge) including the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus
   leucocephalus). Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis), Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo
   jamaicensis), and Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus). Raptors were
   monitored each winter from 1988-89 to 1996-97 using a standardized road
   survey. Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) form a major
   component of the prey base for wintering raptors on the Refuge, with
   1850 ha of active prairie dog towns mapped in 1988. Prairie dog town
   areas and population data were determined by mapping active towns and
   conducting visual counts on study plots to determine population density
   on an annual basis from 1988 to 1996. Large-scale plague epizootics were
   documented on die Refuge in 1988-89 and 1994-95, reducing prairie dog
   towns by 95\% and 99\%, respectively. A significant relationship was
   found in the numeric response of Ferruginous Hawks to changes in prairie
   dog town area (r(2) = 0.96, P < 0.001) and minimum estimated population
   (r(2) = 0.97, P < 0.001), but not to estimated prairie dog density (r(2)
   = 0.07, P = 0.486). This contrasted sharply with the responses to
   prairie dog town area found for Red-tailed (r(2) = 0.11, P = 0.377) and
   Rough-legged Hawks (r(2) = 0.04, P = 0.612).}},

Title = {{Population dynamics of San Joaquin kit foxes at the Naval Petroleum
   Reserves in California}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the population dynamics of the endangered San Joaquin
   kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica) and factors that influence kit fox
   demographics at the Naval Petroleum Reserves in California (NPRC) during
   1980-95. Kit fox abundance varied widely during this period and
   population estimates on a 216-km(2) study area ranged from 46
   (0.21/km(2)) in 1991 to 363 (1.68/km(2)) in 1994. The finite rate of
   increase (lambda) ranged from 0.37 in 1995 to 2.22 in 1993.
   Of 341 adult and 184 juvenile foxes radiocollared, we recovered 225 and
   142 dead, respectively. Mean annual survival rate for adults was 0.44
   (range = 0.20-0.81) and the mean rate for juveniles from 1 May to 15
   February (age 1) was 0.14 (range = <0.01-0.31). Coyotes (Canis latrans)
   and other predators were the primary source of mortality for adult and
   juvenile foxes, and vehicles were a secondary source. Mean annual
   reproductive success (proportion of females observed with pups in
   Apr-May) was 61\% (range = 20-100\%) for adults and 18\% (range =
   0-100\%) for juveniles. Mean annual litter size was 3.8 and varied from
   2.0 to 4.8. Population growth rates varied positively with reproductive
   success (P = 0.041), and both juvenile reproductive success and the
   proportion of new individuals were higher (P = 0.001 and P = 0.100) when
   the fox population was increasing.
   Leporids and kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.) were important foods for kit
   foxes, and annual use of foods by kit foxes varied markedly during the
   study Kit fox density was positively related to both current and
   previous year's composite prey indices (P = 0.001 and P = 0.067). Finite
   growth rates were positively related to rodent indices (P = 0.085) and
   current year's composite prey indices (P = 0.084). Rodent abundance and
   composite prey indices were strongly related to previous year's
   effective (Oct-Mar) precipitation (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003), as were kit
   fox density (P = 0.021) and <lambda> estimates (P = 0.002). A step-wise
   multiple regression model that included precipitation totals from the
   previous 3 years as independent variables explained 79\% (P < 0.001) of
   the annual variation in fox abundance. Survival of adult kit foxes was
   negatively related to abundance of both coyotes (P = 0.046) and leporids
   (the primary prey of coyotes; P = 0.031). However, fox and coyote
   abundance generally tracked each other and neither kit fox abundance nor
   survival increased during a coyote control program conducted during
   1985-90.
   We did not find strong evidence that oilfield activities were impacting
   kit foxes at NPRC. Fox abundance was significantly lower in
   oil-developed areas than in undeveloped areas during 6 of 13 years (P <
   0.006). However, population trends of foxes appeared to be affected more
   by natural factors (e.g., food availability, competitor abundance) than
   oilfield activities.
   Kit fox population trends on NPRC appeared to be driven by
   precipitation-mediated prey abundance. Variation in prey availability,
   particularly kangaroo rats, produced significant and sometimes rapid
   changes in kit fox demographics and abundance. Kit fox abundance in the
   southern San Joaquin Valley is highly dynamic, warranting (1)
   conservation of sufficient habitat to maintain viable populations of
   foxes through population lows, and (2) research on management strategies
   to optimize habitat quality, particularly prey abundance.}},

   waters}},

Abstract = {{The Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin (Sousa chinensis Osbeck, 1765) is
   found throughout the western Pacific and Indian oceans, from southern
   China and northern Australia in the east to South Africa in the west.
   Throughout most of its range it has not been well studied, and in
   southern China very little is known of its biology. The goal of the
   present study was to provide scientific information needed for the
   long-term conservation and management of the population that occurs in
   Hong-Kong waters. From September 1997 to November 1998, 38,105 km of
   systematic line transect surveys were conducted throughout marine waters
   of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People's
   Republic of China (PRC) and adjacent waters to provide data on
   distribution and abundance. Photo-identification of individual dolphins
   allowed for examination of movement patterns, home ranges, and social
   organization. Collection of stranded dolphin carcasses and detailed
   neeropsies provided information on causes of death as well as samples
   for life history studies, such as feeding habits, growth and
   reproduction, ecotoxicology, and stock structure.
   The dolphin population appears to be centered around the Pearl River
   Estuary, and Hong Kong waters represent the eastern portion of the
   range, which extends far into mainland Chinese waters (Lingding Bay) and
   covers at least 1,800 km(2). Within Hong Kong, dolphins only occur in
   western waters around Lantau Island. The area north of Lantau Island is
   heavily used throughout the year and represents by far the most
   important habitat in Hong Kong. Line transect analyses indicate that
   between 88 (spring) and 145 (summer) dolphins occur in Hong Kong. Based
   on 27,6000 photographs taken, 213 individual dolphins were identified.
   The total size of the Pearl River breeding population is unknown, but is
   estimated to consist of at least 1,028 dolphins, based on line transect
   analysis. An apparent decline in the number of dolphins in the North
   Lantau area over the period from 1996-1998 was not statistically
   significant. Individual dolphins have overlapping home ranges of about
   30-400 km(2) in different sections of the population's overall range.
   Groups of dolphins in Hong Kong number up to 23 animals, with an average
   group size of 3.8 +/- s.d. 3.63 animals. There is no significant
   seasonal variation in group size, but groups feeding behind pair trawl
   fishing vessels (mean = 8.3 +/- s.d. 7.84) are significantly larger than
   those in Hong Kong. Groups are very fluid and change composition
   frequently, with association indices ranging from 0-0.333. Behavioral
   patterns are similar to those of other coastal dolphins, but Hong Kong
   hump-backed dolphins only rarely ride bow waves. Following pair trawlers
   represents an important feeding strategy for some individuals.
   Construction work on an airport fuel facility in the dolphins' main
   habitat appears to have caused some disturbance (indicated by increased
   swimming speeds) and possibly temporary evacuation of the surrounding
   area.
   There is a great deal of developmental variation in the color pattern of
   southern Chinese hump-backed dolphins, with a general lightening from
   newborn to adult stages. Males appear to retain more spots in adulthood
   than females. Length at birth appears to be about 100 cm, and postnatal
   development is characterized by rapid growth in the first year and a
   levelling-off of the growth curve after reaching adulthood. Asymptotic
   length is reached at around 243 cm. Length and weight are related
   exponentially, with the maximum weight about 250 kg. Calving occurs
   throughout the year, but most young are born from January through
   August, with a peak in spring/summer. Scant evidence suggests that
   sexual maturity in females is reached at about 9-10 years of age.
   Dolphins feed mainly on several demersal and pelagic fish species that
   are often associated with estuaries. There is a lack of evidence for
   long-distance movements (on the order of hundreds of linear kilometers),
   and this presumably results in isolation of groups around major Chinese
   river mouths. Thus it appears that there may be at least 8 separate
   populations of hump-backed dolphins along the coast of southern China.
   The Pearl River Estuary, including Hong Kong, is apparently inhabited by
   one of these populations, although preliminary genetic work has shown
   only equivocal evidence of population separation from dolphins in the
   Xiamen area. Human-related causes of mortality include entanglement in
   fishing nets and vessel collisions. Some environmental contaminants
   (especially the heavy metal mercury and the pesticide DDT) were found in
   high levels in some dolphins, and preliminary evidence suggests that
   these may be affecting the health of the animals.
   A series of recommendations for management and for further research have
   been made to aid in the conservation of these animals. Principles for
   the conservation of wild living resources should be followed, and
   information from both the natural and social sciences are needed for
   proper management. Research and long-term monitoring of the population
   must continue for management strategies to be evaluated and refined.
   Overall, the population of hump-backed dolphins that occurs in Hong Kong
   waters appears to be viable and should be able to survive with
   appropriate conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were carried out on Georges Bank, a productive coastal
   region in the northwestern sector of the North Atlantic Ocean, and in
   the oligotrophic western Sargasso Sea to examine the effects of nutrient
   (inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic carbon (glucose)
   additions on bacterial and phytoplankton growth. Four experiments were
   conducted in each environment. Phytoplankton growth was monitored over a
   36 h period by following changes in the concentration of chlorophyll in
   unfiltered seawater and in seawater prefiltered through 5 pm screening
   to reduce grazing pressure. Bacterial production was estimated initially
   and after 24 h using the H-3-thymidine (TdR) method in unfiltered
   seawater and in 1 pm filtrate. Phytoplankton biomass increased
   significantly in response to nutrient additions in all but 1 experiment,
   whereas chlorophyll concentrations remained unchanged or decreased in
   all of the unamended (control) treatments or treatments supplemented
   with glucose. Responses of the phytoplankton community were similar for
   the <5 um and unfiltered treatments. Bacterial production increased
   after 24 h in all of the treatments on Georges Bank, and there was
   Little effect of nutrient or glucose addition in unfiltered seawater
   relative to unamended controls. However, glucose addition to the <1 lm
   filtrate caused substantial increases in bacterial production relative
   to controls and N/P-amended treatments in 2 of the experiments from this
   environment. Glucose had no stimulatory effect (relative to unamended
   treatments) in 3 of the 4 Sargasso Sea experiments; and only a marginal
   effect in the fourth. However, the addition of inorganic nitrogen and
   phosphorus in the latter ecosystem resulted in higher bacterial
   production (relative to unamended treatments or glucose addition) in 2
   of the experiments with unfiltered seawater, and very large increases in
   3 of the experiments with 1 pm filtrate. The magnitude of the changes in
   bacterial production differed greatly between unfiltered and filtered
   seawater in both ecosystems, indicating an important role for bacterial
   grazers in controlling bacterial population growth. The results of this
   study indicate different nutritional restraints on bacterial production
   in these contrasting environments.}},

Abstract = {{The small honeycomb barnacle Chamaesipho tasmanica occurs in patches at
   high levels on exposed rocky shores, but often carpets the substratum at
   mid-shore levels of sheltered shores in south-eastern Australia. Studies
   of larval supply from 1990 to 1993 and concurrent monitoring of
   settlement from 1991 to 1993 revealed that larval arrival and settlement
   were typified by trickles of larvae from late July to December (although
   some were observed in January and February). Major pulses of arriving
   cyprids were also recorded once or twice each year. While local patterns
   of water-flow had no impact on numbers of larvae arriving, major peaks
   of larval arrival were always associated with strong southerly winds
   during new and full moons. There was a consistent spatial pattern of
   larval supply; more larvae were always caught in one area low on the
   shore. Numbers of larvae caught were, however, very sporadic within a
   given year and very variable from one year to the next. While the
   different numbers of cyprids in different places cannot be explained by
   cyprids arriving first on lower parts of the shore, longer periods of
   submersion nor aggregations of larvae in the plankton, recurrent
   patterns of arrival of larvae suggest that local site-specific
   characteristics have an influence on the demography of populations of
   this species. Variations in numbers of larvae arriving were responsible
   for the variations in distributions of juveniles on the substratum.

Abstract = {{Data were collected over a two-year period at four localities in
   Mpumalanga Province, South Africa, to formulate a sampling technique for
   monitoring population levels of the citrus thrips, Scirtothrips aurantii
   Faure, in mango orchards. Using a two-stage sampling system for
   determining population levels, the optimum combination of the number of
   trees per orchard (primary units) and fruit per tree (secondary units),
   was estimated. Taylor's power law regression of log(S-2) on log((X) over
   bar..) provided a good fit for both the within-tree (r(2) = 0.887) and
   between-tree (r(2) = 0.746) data. The value for the aggregation
   coefficient, b, in both cases was >1, indicating a clumped distribution.
   Sampling precision, D, improved with increasing average numbers of S.
   aurantii per fruit. In addition, keeping the total number of fruit
   examined constant, sampling precision at low population levels improved
   by increasing the number of trees sampled and decreasing the number of
   fruit examined per tree. Examining 50 fruit per orchard should be
   sufficient for obtaining suitably accurate population estimates for pest
   management purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Long-distance seed dispersal influences many key aspects of the biology
   of plants, including spread of invasive species, metapopulation
   dynamics, and diversity and dynamics in plant communities. However,
   because long-distance seed dispersal is inherently hard to measure,
   there are few data sets that characterize the tails of seed dispersal
   curves. This paper is structured around two lines of argument. First, we
   argue that long-distance seed dispersal is of critical importance and,
   hence, that we must collect better data from the tails of seed dispersal
   curves. To make the case for the importance of long-distance seed
   dispersal, we review existing data and models of long-distance seed
   dispersal, focusing on situations in which seeds that travel long
   distances have a critical impact (colonization of islands, Holocene
   migrations, response to global change, metapopulation biology). Second,
   we argue that genetic methods provide a broadly applicable way to
   monitor long-distance seed dispersal; to place this argument in context,
   we review genetic estimates of plant migration rates. At present,
   several promising genetic approaches for estimating long-distance seed
   dispersal are under active development, including assignment methods,
   likelihood methods, genealogical methods, and genealogical/demographic
   methods. We close the paper by discussing important but as yet largely
   unexplored areas for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Video playbacks have been successfully applied to the study of visual
   communication in several groups of animals. However, this technique is
   controversial as video monitors are designed with the human visual
   system in mind. Differences between the visual capabilities of humans
   and other animals will lead to perceptually different interpretations of
   video images. We simultaneously presented males and females of the
   peacock blenny, Salaria pave, with a live conspecific male and an online
   video image of the same individual. Video images failed to elicit
   appropriate responses. Males were aggressive towards the live male but
   not towards video images of the same male. Similarly, females courted
   only the live male and spent more time near this stimulus. In contrast,
   females of the gynogenetic poecilid Poecilia formosa showed an equal
   preference for a live and video image of a P. mexicana male, suggesting
   a response to live animals as strong as to video images. We discuss
   differences between the species that may explain their opposite reaction
   to video images. (C) 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal

Abstract = {{The fireworm Choristoneura parallela (Robinson) is a major pest in New
   Jersey cranberry bogs where it produces two generations each year. Eggs
   are laid in compact, single-layered masses of a few to >300 eggs on the
   leaves of various plant species, and are parasitized by the endemic
   generalist egg parasite, Trichogramma minutum Riley. In preparation for
   an augmentative biological control program using T. minutum, we assessed
   egg-mass variability and parasitism rates in a series of unmanipulated
   field populations. We examined 193,950 eggs from 1,789 egg masses on 17
   plant species, which represented 12 samples taken from three bogs (one
   sample per generation per bog each year for 2 yr). Egg-mass size, shape,
   and density (number of eggs per unit area, within masses) differed
   across samples and plant species. Egg masses on narrow-leafed species
   (e.g., redroot, swamp candles, and grasses) tended to be longer and
   narrower than those on broad-leafed species (e.g., brier, red maple,
   leatherleaf, marsh Saint John's wort, and marsh fern). Relatively few
   eggs per mass on certain plant species (e.g., marsh fern) indicate
   possible host preferences, whereas unusually high (e.g., grasses, sweet
   pepperbush) or low (e.g., marsh fern) densities indicate additional host
   plant influences on egg mass structure. Overall, T. minutum parasitized
   4,309 eggs (2.2\%) from 271 egg masses (15.1\%) on 12 plant species,
   which included the 11 most common fireworm host plants. Parasitism rates
   for egg masses varied from 1.6 to 44.9\% across samples, and, only Il
   parasitized masses were completely parasitized. (4.1\%). Parasitized
   masses had fewer eggs and lower density than nonparasitized masses, but
   did not differ in length, width, area, or circumference. T. minutum
   exhibited an apparent preference for masses on sweet pepperbush and
   marsh Saint John's wort over those on leatherleaf. This preference was
   not fully explained by egg number ol density, and might be associated
   with other differences among egg masses or host plants. These results
   indicate potentially complex tritrophic interactions that could have
   important implications for the development, monitoring, and success of
   biological control programs.}},

Abstract = {{Although alterations at the organism level in decapod crustaceans on
   exposure to heavy metals have been evidenced in the laboratory, little
   examination of metal effects on morphology and population parameters
   have been explored in a field-based situation. Relationships between
   morphological parameters, population demography and heavy metal sediment
   loadings were examined in conjunction with the accumulation of metals in
   the Semaphore crab, Heloecius cordiformis, in the Port Jackson and
   Hawkesbury River estuaries, Sydney, Australia. H. cordiformis exhibited
   sexual dimorphism, with males having larger carapace width, carapace
   length; chelae length and total mass than females. Sexes were
   subsequently treated separately to assess morphological differences
   among locations. Locations that had greater proportions of females with
   purple chelae and less females in the population tended to have higher
   sediment metal levels. These relationships were maintained over time,
   and could be employed as population-level biological indicators of heavy
   metal stress. Copper and zinc were regulated in the hepatopancreas of H.
   cordiformis. Lead was accumulated in the hepatopancreas of H.
   cordiformis in proportion to sediment lead levels, suggesting the
   species is both an appropriate candidate for bio-indication of lead
   pollution, and Pb is the main metal linked with population level
   differences. Accumulation of lead varied between sexes, indicating that
   sexes must be monitored separately. Smaller males accumulated more lead
   than larger males, suggesting size is an important consideration for
   lead accumulation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wide range diel vertical migrations of fourth-instar Chaoborus larvae
   have been shown in many field and experimental studies, but little
   comparative information is available for the pupae and first three
   larval instars. In this study we monitored the midday and midnight depth
   distributions of different instars in a stratifying lake with abundant
   planktivorous fish as well as in experimental chambers with and without
   fish kairomones. In both the field population exposed to natural fish
   predation in the lake, and experimental animals exposed to fish
   kairomones, we found that the range of migration changed ontogenetically
   in relation to size/instar-specific vulnerability to predation, from a
   nonmigratory behavior among the 1st and 2nd instar larvae, to an
   intermediate-range diel migration in the 3rd instar larvae, and a
   wide-range migration in the 4th instar larvae and pupae (no experimental
   support available for pupae), that are largest and thus most vulnerable
   prey to planktivorous fish. The midday depth and the midnight depth
   selected by the late larvae and the pupae, were also both greater than
   those selected by the early larvae.
   Under laboratory conditions, the range of migration in the 3rd and 4th
   instar larvae from the field population in the lake was significantly
   smaller in animals transferred to a medium free of fish kairomones than
   in those transferred to a medium with fish kairomones, but the migration
   behavior did not fade away completely in 17 days, and nor did the midday
   depth selected by larvae decrease to the level observed in animals grown
   in kairomone-free medium from the time of hatching. The reverse shift in
   behavior was much faster: when naive 4th instar larvae grown in fish
   kairomone-free medium were transferred to medium with fish kairomones,
   the midday mean depth selected by these larvae increased within 12 h,
   and their behavior was changed from nonmigratory to migratory in 48 h.}},

Abstract = {{Evaluation of evolutionary mechanisms proposed to promote cooperative
   behavior depends on the relative influence of the behavior on the
   reproductive success of individuals, the reproductive success of the
   group in which they interact behaviorally, and the degree of gene
   correlation among cooperators. The genetic relationship within
   cooperative coalitions of female red howler monkeys was examined for
   three populations with different densities and growth rates. Patterns of
   gene correlation change within coalitions is documented using data from
   the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, and long-term census monitoring.
   Differences in fecundity and infant survivorship within and between
   groups of unrelated ((r) over bar=0) and related ((r) over bar greater
   than or equal to 0.25) females are compared. Females that emigrate from
   their natal groups form coalitions with other migrant females. These
   coalitions attempt to establish a territory and, once successful in
   producing offspring, exclude other females from feeding resources.
   Females in these coalitions had different mtDNA haplotypes and a
   genetically estimated mean r of 0, supporting demographic data on
   emigration patterns indicating that these females rarely have the
   opportunity to form coalitions with kin. Patterns of recruitment and
   rate of matriline development within social groups supported behavioral
   data indicating that females actively attempt to promote their own
   matriline as breeders over that of other females, and that some
   matrilines are more successful at this than others. Mean r among females
   was significantly higher in coalitions established as social groups for
   several generations ((r) over bar=0.44). In these groups, females all
   shared the same mtDNA haplotype, and mtDNA haplotype divergence was
   significantly higher between than within groups. Females in coalitions
   with kin had significantly higher reproductive success than females in
   unrelated coalitions in all populations. This difference was not a
   function of coalition size, number of males, socionomic sex ratio, or
   primiparity, although anecdotal evidence suggests that allomothering may
   compensate for inept new mothers in related coalitions more often than
   in unrelated ones. Differences in territory quality could not be ruled
   out as a potential causal factor in the saturated populations, but were
   unlikely in the low-density, growing population. There were substantial
   differences among long-established coalitions in overall reproductive
   output in all three populations, and this was significantly correlated
   with the number of breeding females. Increase in coalition size was a
   function of both group age and the behavioral tolerance among females.
   Regardless of the underlying reasons for the patterns observed,
   reproductive success clearly increases with degree of gene correlation
   among females within cooperative coalitions, and coalitions that recruit
   more daughters produce more offspring. The nature of the cooperative
   relationship among group females directly influences both of these
   outcomes. This is associated with substantial genetic differentiation
   among social groups within populations, creating conditions in which
   genetic tendencies towards cooperative behavior can become tightly
   associated with group reproductive success.}},

Abstract = {{Dolomedes plantarius, a semi-aquatic spider, occurs at only two sites in
   the UK. At Lopham and Redgrave Fen NNR, groundwater abstraction between
   1960 and 1999 dried out the pools on which the spider depended, reducing
   its range by over 80\% and leaving two small, isolated populations. A
   population index, based on systematic monitoring from 1991 to 1999,
   showed significant variation between years and between the two
   populations, one of which showed a slight but significant positive
   trend. Changes in the density of spiders on the pools and the numbers of
   occupied pools contributed to variation in the index to differing
   extents in the two populations. The age structure of the populations was
   highly variable between years and there was no relationship between the
   abundance of spiders and the numbers of nursery webs. Factors
   contributing to the persistence of D. plantarius at this site, and
   obstacles to its recovery following hydrological restoration in 1999,
   are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used three sampling methods to identify the arthropod predators most
   abundant and active in fields of cabbage, Brassica oleracea L. var.
   capitata, and determined those most likely to be important predators of
   the imported cabbagcworm, Pieris rapae L., by testing the predators'
   abilities to forage on cabbage plants and to feed on Pieris rapae in
   small arenas in the laboratory. Abundance and activity in the field were
   monitored with pitfall traps, sticky traps applied directly to leaves,
   and plant samples. Four criteria were used to assess the species'
   potential value as a predator of Pieris rapae in cabbage: relatively
   high overall abundance in trap catches and plant samples, occurrence on
   plant foliage in the field, a high propensity to feed on Pieris rapae
   eggs and first instars, and the ability to search for larval Pieris
   rapae on cabbage plants. Four species, the wolf spider Pardosa milvina
   (Hentz) (Araneae: Lycosidae), the harvestman Phalanlgium opilio L.
   (Opiliones: Phalangiidae), and the lady beetles Coleomegilla maculata
   lengi Timberlake and Hippodamia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera:
   Coccinellidae), demonstrated these attributes, although all four species
   appeared unable to search for prey on some parts of the cabbage plants,
   owing to unsure footing on the plants' slippery cuticular wax.
   Linyphiids (Araneae) and syrphids (Diptera), the most abundant taxa in
   the plant samples, may prove better at thoroughly searching cabbage
   plants, but remain to be tested in future laboratory trials. Our results
   show that only a small portion of the predatory arthropod species that
   occur in cabbage fields is likely to prey on Pieris rapae on the plants,
   although important questions remain about the roles of some taxa. Future
   efforts to enhance biological control of Pic ris rapae by naturally
   occurring predators can now focus on further elucidating and finding
   ways to enhance the roles of those predators that are effective.}},

Abstract = {{Many researchers and managers believe that land-use practices are most
   responsible for declines in northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus)
   populations. Additionally, researchers have suggested that the amount of
   available escape cover in a landscape could alter winter survival of
   bobwhites. A comparative study of winter bobwhite ecology was conducted
   on rangeland and cropland ecosystems in east-central Kansas (11 November
   - 31 January 1993-1996). We considered woody cover type on our study
   areas to be an escape cover for quail. We used radiotelemetry to
   investigate survival, movement, and cover-type selection. Over the
   3-year period, we monitored 91 individuals on a cropland study area
   (CSA) and 66 birds on a rangeland study area (RSA). Survival was higher
   on the CSA (0.46) than on the RSA (0.27) (P = 0.03); the difference was
   due to increased harvest mortality on the RSA (P = 0.04). Mean daily
   covey movement was higher on the RSA than on the CSA (P < 0.01).
   Comparing cover-type selection between study areas, it was found that
   bobwhites selected cropland more on the RSA than on the CSA (P < 0.01).
   On the RSA, increased daily movement correlated with decreased selection
   for woody cover and increased selection for cropland (P < 0.02). On the
   CSA, increased woody-cover selection decreased natural predation (P =
   0.03). On the RSA, decreased movement, increased woody cover, and
   decreased pasture selection reduced natural predation (P < 0.05).
   However, increased woody-cover selection increased harvest mortality (P
   < 0.01). Consequently, we consider the selection for woody cover to be
   an important variable in bobwhite survival on the RSA. It is suggested
   that landowners on rangelands could reduce natural mortality by taking
   advantage of programs available from federal and state governments and
   nongovernmental organizations, to increase woody cover for bobwhites.}},

Abstract = {{Pen Branch, a third order stream on the Savannah River Site (SRS),
   located near Aiken, SC, USA, received thermal effluents from the cooling
   system of a nuclear production reactor from 1954 to 1988. The thermal
   effluent and increased flow destroyed vegetation in the stream corridor
   (i.e, impacted portion of the floodplain), and subsequent erosion
   created a braided stream system with a greatly expanded delta.
   Restoration of the area began with planting of bottomland hardwood
   species in 1993. Occurrence of amphibians and reptiles was monitored by
   daily sampling from 1 January 1995 through 30 September 1996 to
   characterize the course of the restoration. Vegetation was sampled in
   the summer of 1996 to characterize the habitats in the unimpacted
   riparian zone and the impacted stream corridor. A total of 12 580
   individuals representing 72 species of herpetofauna were captured. There
   were no significant differences in relative abundance or diversity of
   herpetofauna in unplanted versus planted zones within the impacted
   corridor 3 years after planting. Likewise, there were no significant
   differences in abundance or diversity of herpetofauna in the upper and
   lower corridor areas, which differed in site preparation before
   planting, or in riparian zones of different widths. However, species
   diversity of amphibians and reptiles in the unimpacted riparian zone was
   significantly higher than on vegetated islands located between stream
   braids within the impacted floodplain corridor. There were also
   significantly more species and individuals within the riparian zone than
   in the corridor, and the species assemblage within the riparian zone
   differed from that of the corridor. Woody vegetation within the
   unimpacted riparian zone was significantly higher in basal area than on
   islands within the corridor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An extensive survey of the breeding population of the Northern Giant
   Petrel Macronectes halli on Campbell Island was conducted during the

   increasing at some locations and decreasing at others. Comparison of the
   1996-97 Campbell Island population estimate with historic records is
   unreliable as past surveys were often limited in the areas searched or
   were based on anecdotal evidence of breeding occurences. Northern Giant
   Petrels often move their nest site from year to year and so
   representative surveys of a restricted area are not appropriate for this
   species. Long-term monitoring of the where population is required in
   order to detect true population trends.}},

   Growers in the north central United States have noticed and treated
   concentrations of adults at the edge of some of their potato fields each
   spring. Based on sampling in commercial potato fields over a 2-year
   period, early planted fields that are adjacent to the previous year's
   potato crop are most likely to have concentrations of adults at the
   field edge. Frequency of fields with significantly more adults at the
   edges than in the center sections as well as adult population density in
   the center sections of fields declined with both distance from the
   previous potato field and later planting date. The effects of both
   physical and chemical barriers to movement into potato fields from the
   field edges were studied in small plot trials and at the edges of
   commercial potato fields. In small plot trials, physical barriers had a
   greater impact than chemical barriers on adult beetle movement from a
   potato trap crop to the protected potatoes beyond the barrier. Barrier
   treatments reduced beetle numbers in and just beyond the barrier in
   commercial fields, but the effects were localized and no significant
   reduction of beetles was observed further into the field. Beetle flight
   was hypothesized to be responsible for the localized effects of barrier
   treatments and the lack of edge concentrations in later planted and more
   distantly rotated fields. In field studies, larger potato plants
   attracted more colonizing potato beetles than smaller plants. Attracting
   Colorado potato beetles to trap crops containing potato plants that were
   larger than those in the remainder of the field, however, provided no
   significant reduction of beetles in the remainder of the field. We found
   little opportunity to reduce beetle populations with trap crops at the
   edges of potato fields without controlling the adults in the trap crop
   itself. Growers can exploit naturally occurring concentrations of adults
   at the edges of early and adjacent potato plantings if they are prepared
   to monitor and regularly treat the field edges.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a measure of developmental stability, has
   been suggested as a monitoring tool for environmental pollution. Aquatic
   pollution events are often transitional and the level of FA in
   populations exposed to such incidents has not yet been investigated.
   Research into the morphological effects of transitional pollution also
   provides a tool to elucidate the timing and duration of any `window of
   opportunity' for the determination of FA in the developing organism. The
   present study was undertaken to investigate if exposure of the last
   instar of the damselfly Xanthocnemis zealandica (McLachlan) (Zygoptera:
   Coenagrionidae) to different levels of insecticidal stress resulted in
   different levels of FA in the wings of the adult insects and if adult
   emergence was altered by different concentrations of pesticide. Three
   concentrations of carbaryl (40 ppb, 2 ppb and 0.1 ppb) and a control
   were used. The emergence success of the damselflies was not affected by
   any treatment, but the insecticide had a stimulatory effect on the
   developing larvae. Exposure of the last instar of X. zealandica to
   carbaryl at 40 ppb had no consistent effect on FA in metric traits and
   increased FA in meristic traits compared with the control. Segregation
   of the emerged adults into two groups revealed more details about the
   `window of opportunity' in the meristic traits. Larvae which had already
   completed more than half of their development when the experiment
   started did not show significant differences in the level of FA. In
   contrast, damselflies which were exposed for more than half of the final
   instar showed a clear difference in their levels of FA. The greater
   difference in the latter group was mainly caused by a decrease of FA in
   the controls rather than by an increase in the treatment. These data
   suggest that the `window of opportunity' for the determination of the
   level of FA of the meristic traits in damselfly wings closes
   approximately halfway through the final larval instar.}},

Abstract = {{Iwao's quadratic regression or Taylor's Power Law (TPL) are commonly
   used to model the variance as a function of the mean for sample counts
   of insect populations which exhibit spatial aggregation. The modeled
   variance and distribution of the mean are typically used in pest
   management programs to decide if the population is above the action
   threshold in any management unit (MU) (e.g., orchard, forest
   compartment). For nested or multi-level sampling the usual two-stage
   modeling procedure first obtains the sample variance for each MU and
   sampling level using ANOVA and then fits a regression of variance on the
   mean for each level using either Iwao or TPL variance models. Here this
   approach is compared to the single-stage procedure of fitting a
   generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) directly to the count data with
   both approaches demonstrated using 2-level sampling. GLMMs and additive
   GLMMs (AGLMMs) with conditional Poisson variance function as well as the
   extension to the negative binomial are described. Generalization to more
   than two sampling levels is outlined. Formulae for calculating optimal
   relative sample sizes (ORSS) and the operating characteristic curve for
   the control decision are given for each model. The ORSS are independent
   of the mean in the case of the AGLMMs.
   The application described is estimation of the variance of the mean
   number of leaves per shoot occupied by immature stages of a defoliator
   of eucalypts, the Tasmanian Eucalyptus leaf beetle, based on a sample of
   trees within plots from each forest compartment. Historical population
   monitoring data were fitted using the above approaches.}},

Abstract = {{During water treatment, chlorine reacts with naturally occurring organic
   matter in surface water to produce a number of by-products. Of the
   by-products formed, trihalomethanes (THMs) are among the highest in
   concentration. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the
   relationship between the level of total THM and specific THMs in public
   water supplies and risk for stillbirth. The cohort was assembled from a
   population-based perinatal database in the Canadian province of Nova
   Scotia and consisted of almost 50,000 singleton deliveries between 1988
   and 1995 Individual exposures were assigned by linking mother's
   residence at the time of delivery to the levels of specific THMs
   monitored in public water supplies. Analysis was conducted for all
   stillbirths and for cause-of-death categories based on the physiologic
   process responsible for the fetal death. Total THMs and the specific
   THMs were each associated with increased stillbirth risk. The strongest
   association was observed for bromodichloromethane exposure, where risk
   doubled for those exposed to a level of greater than or equal to 20 mu
   g/L compared to those exposed to a level < 5 mu g/L (relative risk =
   1.98, 95\% confidence interval, 1.23-3.49). Relative risk estimates
   associated with THM exposures were larger for asphyxia-related deaths
   than for unexplained deaths or for stillbirths overall. These findings
   suggest a need to consider specific chlorination by-products in relation
   to stillbirth risk, in particular bromodichloromethane and other
   by-product correlates. The finding of a stronger effect for asphyxia
   deaths requires confirmation and research into possible mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{We present evidence for a decline in the population of the American eel
   (Anguilla rostrata) from several widely distributed regions of North
   America from 1984 to 1995. Trends in population indices from commercial
   catch data, upstream passage counts, and seine,trawl, and electrofishing
   surveys were analyzed and found to be either not significant or
   significantly negative. Explanations for this decline, whether natural
   or anthropogenic, are unknown, due to variation and incompleteness in
   abundance data, and incomplete knowledge of eel life history, ecology,
   and population dynamics. A number of potential factors may be
   contributing to the decline, including (in alphabetical order): barriers
   to migration, habitat loss and alteration, hydro turbine mortality,
   oceanic conditions, overfishing, parasitism, and pollution. The paucity
   of life table data associated with the unconventional life history
   characteristics of anguillid eels (catadromy, panmixis, semelparity,
   high age at maturity, wide geographic distribution, and ecological
   generalist habit) prevents development of accurate population models and
   determination of overall effects influencing production and recruitment
   for this species. Historically there has been little attention to
   management of this species. A new coast-wide management initiative by
   the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission has taken a conservative
   approach to limiting controllable and anthropogenic sources of mortality
   and enhancing recruitment and restoration of available habitat.
   Objectives of the plan include: improving knowledge of eel utilization
   through better reporting of harvest, increasing knowledge of eel
   population dynamics and life history, providing migratory passage and
   access to historic eel freshwater habitat, and monitoring of abundance
   levels of various eel life stages.}},

Abstract = {{In 1992 the UK Forestry Commission established a field experiment in
   Hafren Forest, Wales, to determine the impact of green spruce aphid
   (Elatobium abietinum) and root-aphids (Pachypappa spp.) on the growth of
   young, 3-5 year-old Sitka spruce. Four experimental treatments were
   created by applying insecticides to maintain or control E. abietinum and
   root-aphids, together or separately, on replicated plots of trees. A
   fifth treatment of high E. abietinum densities was produced by infesting
   trees with aphids artificially in spring 1994. Aphid populations and
   tree growth were monitored closely from September 1993 until 1997.
   Root-aphids at the low, but typical densities present had no detectable
   effect on,growth. Natural populations of E. abietinum also were low
   during the study period, but numbers on the artificially infested trees
   reached densities equivalent to a moderate-severe outbreak by June 1994
   before declining (Straw N.A., Fielding, N.F., Green, G., Coggan, A.,
   1998. The impact of green spruce aphid, Elatobium abietinum (Walker), on
   the growth of young Sitka spruce in Hafren Forest, Wales: pattern of
   defoliation and effect on shoot growth. For. Ecol. Mgmt. 104, 209-225).
   The high densities of E. abietinum caused 38.5\% defoliation of older
   needles and reduced height increment (leader length) by 22.4\% in 1994
   (p < 0.001), 11.5\% in 1995 (p < 0.01) and by about 6\% in 1996. Stem
   diameter and volume increments were not affected in 1994, but were
   reduced by 12.2\% and 23.8\%, respectively, in 1995. No effect was
   apparent in 1996. Overall differences between treatments in diameter and
   volume increment were not significant on account of smaller sample sizes
   and greater variability in parameter estimates, but regressions of
   increment against peak aphid densities recorded in 1994 were significant
   (p < 0.05) and confirmed the association of E, abietinum with these
   growth parameters. The reductions in increment observed could nor be
   explained as a consequence of defoliation, but appeared to be caused by
   an effect of E. abietinum on shoot extension at the time of infestation
   and a related influence on the formation of winter buds. The disruption
   of bud-set appears to reduce the biomass and/or quality of foliage
   produced in the following year and, as a result, the supply of current
   photosynthate available for stem diameter and volume growth. Crown

Abstract = {{The impact of inbreeding and hybridization on fitness was compared in
   the two co-occurring forest tree species, Eucalyptus ovata and E.
   globulus, aimed at explaining the rarity of their hybrids in nature. The
   success of selfing, open-pollination and outcrossing of both species and
   interspecific hybridization was monitored from seed-set to 10-year's
   growth in a field trial. There was a unilateral barrier to hybridization
   with seed-set obtained only with E. ovata females. The F-1 hybrids
   exhibited reduced viability compared to intraspecific cross-types at
   virtually all stages of the life cycle and are clearly at a selective
   disadvantage compared with their open-pollinated E. ovata half-sibs with
   which they would directly compete in nature. Eucalyptus ovata and E.
   globulus overlap in their flowering time but the F1 hybrids flowered
   later with virtually no overlap with either species. The asynchronous
   flowering and reduced reproductive fitness of F-1 hybrids would markedly
   limit the opportunity for advanced generation hybridization. Inbreeding
   similarly had a deleterious effect on the fitness of both species, and
   the F-1 hybrids were most competitive with the E. ovata selfs. It is
   argued that changes in inbreeding levels of parental populations may be
   a key factor affecting the relative fitness of hybrids and their
   potential to impact on the pure species gene pool. Reduced fitness of
   the pure species through inbreeding may result in hybridization having
   its greatest evolutionary impact in small founder or relict populations.}},

Abstract = {{One-year-old rope-grown blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) were held in
   experimental lantern nets and cross-transplanted between two sea lochs
   (Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn) on the west coast of Scotland. Growth,
   mortality and shell morphology were monitored in the native and
   transplanted stocks for twelve months. There were significant
   differences (p <0.05) in growth rates between the lochs. Both native and
   transplanted mussels performed better (shell, live and wet meat weights)
   in Loch Etive than in Loch Kishorn. There were no significant effects of
   stock or stock{*}site interaction on growth parameters (p >0.05).
   Mortality rates were 7.3\% in native and 17.1\% in transplanted mussels
   in Loch Etive and 10.8\% in native and 16.5\% in transplanted mussels in
   Loch Kishorn. There was a significant stock effect on mortality (p
   <0.001), but not site effect (p>0.05). There were significant
   morphological differences (shell length, height and width ratios)
   between the Loch Etive and Loch Kishorn populations. Loch Etive mussels
   had higher height:length (p <0.001), width:length and width:height
   ratios (p <0.05) than Loch Kishorn mussels after the one year reciprocal
   transfer. The differences in growth rate were related to environmental
   factors, while morphological differences most probably resulted from
   genotypic differences between the stocks.}},

Title = {{Simulating the spread and management of alien riparian weeds: are they

Pages = {{28-38}},

Abstract = {{1. This paper examines the circumstances under which control programmes
   may reduce the range of two widespread invasive weeds of riparian
   habitats: Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan balsam) and Heracleum
   mantegazzianum (giant hogweed).
   2. The spread of both species was modelled using MIGRATE, a spatially
   explicit model that incorporates realistic demographic parameters and
   multiple dispersal mechanisms. Simulations of a range of control
   scenarios were run within a geographical information system (GIS) using
   authentic landscapes based on topographic, hydrological and land cover
   maps of County Durham, UK. Results were interpreted at both a catchment
   and a regional scale.
   3. Six representative strategies were explored that prioritized control
   as follows: at random, in relation to human population density, or by
   the size, age (new and old) or spatial distribution of weed populations.
   These strategies were assessed at different intensities of management
   (area treated per year) and for varying efficiencies (proportion of
   plants destroyed) as well as the timeliness (how long since the species
   became established) of implementations.
   4. Strategies that prioritized control based on weed population and
   spatial characteristics were most effective, with plant population size
   and spatial distribution being the key parameters. The reduction in
   geographical range within a catchment or region following control was
   always greater for H. mantegazzianum than I. glandulifera due to its
   slower rate of spread.
   5. Successful control of both species at a regional scale is only
   possible for strategies based on species distribution data, undertaken
   at relatively high intensities and efficiencies. The importance of
   understanding the spatial structure of the population and potential
   habitat available, as well as being able to monitor the progress of the
   eradication programme, is highlighted. Tentative conclusions an offered
   as to the feasibility of eradicating these species at a regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers have developed a variety of computer-based models to
   estimate population exposure to air pollution. These models typically
   estimate exposures by simulating the movement of specific population
   groups through defined microenvironments. During the summer of 1998 and
   winter of 1999, researchers with the Harvard School of Public Health
   (HSPH) conducted a field study in Baltimore, MD, to acquire data for
   improving microenvironmental models. Using a special roll-around
   instrument system, a technician measured 1- and 12-h pollutant
   concentrations while engaging in scripted sequences of activities
   typical of retirees. Each scripted activity assigned the technician to a
   geographic location and to a microenvironment. The technician recorded
   special conditions associated with each activity (e.g., open windows,
   environmental tobacco smoke) in a real-time diary. Data on ambient
   pollutant levels, temperature, and other potential explanatory factors
   were also collected. Eleven pollutants were measured by the roll-around
   instrument system, including particulate matter with an aerodynamic
   diameter less than 2.5 mum (PM2.5), ozone, carbon monoxide, and benzene.
   This article presents the results of statistical analyses performed
   solely on the 1-h PM2.5 data measured by a DustTrak monitor, which
   ranged from 1.5 to 444.8 mug/m(3) with a median value of 14.6 mug/m(3).
   Results of stepwise linear regression (SLR) suggest that PM2.5 exposure
   is significantly increased by passive smoking, high ambient PM2.5
   concentrations reported by fixed-site monitors, food preparation,
   charcoal grills, car travel, outdoor roadside locations, and high
   humidity. Analysts should explicitly represent the effects of these
   parameters within any model developed to estimate population exposure to
   PM2.5. In a related study, a panel of volunteer retirees each carried a
   personal PM2.5 monitor and a real-time diary for nominal 24-h sampling
   periods as they engaged in normal daily activities. A regression
   equation derived from SLR analysis of the scripted activity database was
   applied to eight subject-days of diary data provided by the volunteer
   seniors to produce estimates of PM2.5 exposure for each event documented
   in each diary. The event-specific exposure estimates were then averaged
   over all events in each sampling period to produce nominal 24-h average
   exposure estimates. The absolute difference between the estimate
   obtained from the regression equation and the corresponding personal
   monitor measurement averaged 13\%. The fixed-site monitors generally
   provided poorer estimates of exposure; the absolute differences for the
   Old Town and Clifton Park monitors averaged 26.7\% and 19.5\%,
   respectively, of the personal monitor values.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the assumptions of thr Mayfield method (Mayfield 1975) using
   416 Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) nests monitored from 1993-1997 in
   the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. We tested for differences in
   nest survival throughout the breeding season and throughout the: nesting
   cycle. We compared the Mayfield cumulative survival curve with a
   modified version of the Kaplan-Meier with staggered entry. In addition,
   we compared the group of nests found during nest initiation with those
   found later in the nesting cycle. There was no evidence nest survival
   varied through the breeding season or with different stages of the
   nesting cycle. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve agreed with
   the Mayfield calculation. We found no evidence of heterogeneity.
   Validation of Mayfield assumptions is important because the method is
   widely used, allows for statistical comparisons, and is critical for
   estimating seasonal fecundity in bird populations.}},

Abstract = {{Mortality and fertility rates are decreasing rapidly in many developing
   countries. It is argued that the indices commonly used as measures of
   these changes, i.e. infant mortality rate and fertility rate, ignore the
   interaction between mortality and fertility, and do not reflect their
   combined impact in lowering overall infant mortality. The paper proposes
   new indicators of infant mortality, termed fertility-adjusted infant
   mortality ratio (FIMR), age-specific, fertility-adjusted IMR (AFIMR),
   and total infant mortality ratio (TIMR) that are more sensitive to rapid
   demographic changes. These indicators include the combined effects of
   changes in both fertility and infant mortality rates on overall infant
   mortality in a region and appear to measure the effects of integrated
   health programmes better. Further, these conceptualize the mother-infant
   pair as an appropriate unit with which to monitor mortality, and may be
   used for guiding allocation of resources intended to lower infant
   mortality. The application and usefulness of these indicators have been
   illustrated, using one hypothetical example and empirical data from the
   maternal-child health and family-planning programme in Matlab,
   Bangladesh, as well as data from white and black population groups in
   the U.S.A. The results of these examples demonstrate that the new
   indicators are more sensitive than traditional measures when describing
   infant mortality, and may better reflect the perception in infant
   mortality status in the community.}},

Abstract = {{To test the feasibility of using captive-reared Orinoco crocodiles to
   restock depleted wild populations we used radio-telemetry to monitor
   eight crocodiles (103.3-139.3 cm total length) released in the
   Capanaparo River in southwestern Venezuela. Crocodiles were located
   every 1-2 d from April 1991 to March 1992 to determine movement
   patterns, survivorship, and growth rates. The crocodiles moved
   considerably during the first month following release, and the maximum
   distance moved was 11.6 km upstream by one crocodile four months after
   release. However, following an initial period of movement, crocodiles
   became more sedentary and by the end of the study the maximum distance
   from the point of release was less than 8 km. Six of the eight
   crocodiles moved upstream while two moved up to 3.3 km downstream.
   Crocodiles remained principally along the main course of the river in
   areas with mixed shallow and deep water habitats and abundant sand
   beaches. As the river rose during the wet season, crocodiles remained in
   the same areas, but moved into shallow-water areas among hooded riparian
   vegetation. The mean growth rate of released crocodiles (0.079 cm
   TL/day) was similar to that of smaller wild-born juvenile crocodiles.
   One animal was accidentally killed by a local resident who was hunting
   spectacled caiman. Based on the results of this study, we feel that a
   carefully designed program of releases of captive-reared crocodiles can
   be an effective conservation tool to speed the recovery of depleted
   populations of Orinoco crocodiles. However, care must be taken to insure
   that the release program is designed as one component of an overall
   crocodile strategy and not an excuse to avoid the onerous issues of the
   protection of wild crocodile populations and their habitat.}},

Abstract = {{The value of skeletal cyclic growth marks, or SGMs, for age estimation
   in the Nile monitor, Varanus niloticus, a species highly exploited for

   in vivo labelling of bone growth. The basic histological features of the
   SGMs are described, as well as the variability in the structure of these
   marks with regard to the skeletal elements considered, the technique for
   processing the sections, and differences between populations or
   individuals. Ground sections from the shaft of the fibula, observed
   under transmitted polarized light, are best suited for counting growth
   marks. Bone labelling indicates that SGMs have an annual periodicity and
   can thus be reliable age indicators as long as somatic growth proceeds.
   The formation of SGMs is interpreted with reference to the ecology of
   the Nile monitors. The practical value of skeletochronology for

Title = {{Early warning of malaria epidemics in African highlands using Anopheles
   (Diptera : Culicidae) indoor resting density}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Several highland regions of Africa recently have suffered malaria
   epidemics. Because malaria transmission is unstable and the population
   has little or no immunity, these highlands are prone to explosive
   outbreaks when densities of Anopheles exceed critical levels and
   conditions favor transmission. If an incipient epidemic can be detected
   early enough, control efforts may reduce morbidity, mortality, and
   transmission. Here we present three methods (direct, minimum sample
   size, and sequential sampling approaches) that could be used to
   determine whether the household indoor resting density of Anopheles
   gambiae s.l, has exceeded critical levels associated with epidemic
   transmission. Data on Anopheles density before, during, and after a
   malaria epidemic (December 1997-July 1998) in the highlands of
   southwestern Uganda were evaluated to demonstrate the application of
   these three approaches. During this epidemic, a density of 0.25
   Anopheles mosquitoes per house was associated with epidemic
   transmission, whereas 0.05 mosquitoes per house was chosen as a normal
   level expected during nonepidemic months. The direct approach to
   calculating mean Anopheles density with an allowable error of 20-50\% of
   the mean would require the sampling of 102-16 houses, respectively. In
   contrast, with only seven houses, the minimum sample size approach could
   be used to determine whether Anopheles density had exceeded the critical
   level. This method, however, would result in an overestimation of the
   risk of an epidemic at low Anopheles density. Finally, a sequential
   sampling plan could require as man) as 50 houses to conclude that risk
   of an epidemic existed, but this disadvantage is offset by the ability
   to preset the probabilities of concluding that risk of an epidemic
   exists at both the critical and normal Anopheles densities. Our study
   illustrated that it is feasible, and probably expedient, to include
   monitoring of Anopheles density in highland malaria epidemic early
   warning systems.}},

Abstract = {{Roundups are used to maintain feral horse populations in balance with
   rangeland grazing capacity, but little is known about short-term and
   long-term effects of roundups on horses. We evaluated the effects of
   roundups on behavior and reproduction of feral horses. The study was
   conducted near Challis, Ida. during 1994-1995, and repeated near Lander,
   Wyo. during 1995-1996. Horses were randomly assigned to 3 different
   treatment groups. One group (ADOPTED) was gathered by a Bureau of Land
   Management roundup crew using a helicopter. These horses were removed
   and placed in the Adopt-A-Horse Program. The second group (SIMULATED)
   consisted of horses that were gathered by helicopter, but these horses
   evaded capture and remained in the study area after the roundup. Horses
   in the third group (CONTROL) were not herded by helicopter. Horse
   behavior was monitored in the SIMULATED and CONTROL groups before and
   after roundups. Behavioral variables analyzed were the percentage of
   time spent resting, feeding, vigilant, traveling, and engaged in
   agonistic encounters. Neither foraging or social behavior of feral
   horses was affected by roundups in either study area (P > 0.10).
   Reproduction was monitored within the SIMULATED, CONTROL, and ADOPTED
   groups during the year following roundups. The percentages of mares with
   live foals did not differ (P > 0.10) among the 3 treatment groups in
   Idaho or Wyoming. Foaling success rates in Idaho were 29\%, 31\%, and
   43\% for CONTROL, ADOPTED, and SIMULATED mares, respectively. In
   Wyoming, foaling success rates were 29\%, 42\%, and 48\% for CONTROL,
   ADOPTED, and SIMULATED groups, respectively. We found no evidence that
   roundups had deleterious effects on behavior or reproduction of feral
   horses.}},

Abstract = {{Tiller recruitment is an essential process for ensuring the perenniality
   of grasses. The timing and extent of tiller recruitment and the role of
   biennial tillers must be documented for key range species. Prairie
   sandreed {[}Calamovilfa longifolia (Hook) Scribn.] is an important grass
   in the Nebraska Sandhills for both ecological functioning and as a
   forage. The objective of this study was to document tiller recruitment
   patterns and the occurrence and contribution of current year and
   biennial tillers to biomass production in prairie sandreed at 2
   locations in Nebraska. Tiller recruitment was monitored at 2-week
   periods throughout the growing season during a 2-year period. Newly
   emerged tillers were classified as intravaginal, extravaginal, or
   rhizomatous tillers and marked with colored wire. Prairie sandreed has
   an unimodal pattern of tiller recruitment and over 50\% of the current
   year tillers emerged by mid-May and 80\% by mid-June. Rate of tiller
   emergence and absolute number of emerged tillers were poorly correlated
   with short- and long-term precipitation totals (r < 0.3 P > 0.20). The
   year after new tillers were marked, biennial tillers and tillers
   initiated during the current-year were counted and clipped in September
   for biomass determination. Biennial tillers made up only 6 and 20\% of
   the total tiller emergence at these locations and were generally only
   30\% as large as the new tillers. Extravaginal tillers composed over
   78\% of the biennial tiller population as a result of both their
   dominance in emerging populations and the higher percentage of tillers
   that survived the winter. Current year tillers contributed the most to
   prairie sandreed forage production and their emergence was largely
   completed by mid-June. The lack of a relationship between tiller
   recruitment and precipitation patterns, combined with previous studies
   of prairie sandreed, indicates that tiller recruitment involves a
   process that begins the previous growing season.}},

   germination under field conditions was greatest on toe slope positions
   and areas of soil disturbance. Number of sheets varied annually for
   established hoary cress populations. Shoot propagation was reduced when
   early spring growth was followed by frost or drought. Shoot numbers were
   increased when spring growth was delayed and warm, moist growing
   conditions occurred in May. Seed reproduction did not increase plant
   density in monitored populations. Established populations relied upon

Abstract = {{Tadpole development was compared in three amphibian species (Bufo
   calamita, B. bufo and Rana temporaria) that suffer different risks of
   pond desiccation in nature. Using a replicated pond system, development
   was monitored in desiccating and non-desiccating ponds, and in
   vertical-sided and gently shelving ('shoreline') ponds. In desiccating
   ponds, tadpoles suffered from crowding effects and metamorphosed at a
   smaller size, but development was not accelerated in response to
   desiccation in any of the three species. Desiccating ponds had higher
   maximum temperatures but also lower minimum temperatures, which may
   explain the lack of ally difference in development time between
   desiccating and non-desiccating ponds. Although shoreline ponds were
   slightly warmer than vertical-sided ponds, development under these
   conditions was also consistent with a crowding, rather than a
   temperature, effect. In shoreline ponds, metamorphosis generally took
   longer, was less synchronized between individuals, and resulted in a
   smaller size at metamorphosis, compared to development in vertical-sided
   ponds. The lack of species-by-desiccation interactions indicated that
   there were no differences between the three species in developmental
   plasticity. Developmental constraints may place a limit on the degree of
   plasticity that can evolve in a species such as B, calamita, which
   breeds only in ephemeral ponds with a variable hydroperiod.
   Alternatively, low genetic variability within British populations of B.
   calamita may have cont;trained the evolution of adaptive plasticity in
   this species.}},

Abstract = {{Heart rate variations of a population of the limpet Patella vulgata were
   monitored in the natural environment (Lough Hyne, southern Ireland) by
   noninvasive, optoelectronic recording. The heart rates of 145 limpets of
   different sizes, living on vertical and horizontal substrata, were
   measured both in air and water at different environmental temperatures,
   while the animals were inactive on their home scars. The heart rates of
   emersed, inactive limpets were positively related to air temperature and
   negatively related to limpet size. These relationships were similar for
   limpets on vertical and horizontal substrates. In contrast, no
   significant relationship between heart rate and temperature was found in
   submerged limpets, probably due to the narrow thermal range of the water
   during the study period. During submersion, a significant negative
   relationship between heart rate and size was evident for limpets on
   vertical surfaces but not for limpets on horizontal surfaces. In
   general, submerged limpets had a higher heart rate, 1.16 times that of
   limpets exposed to air. Moreover, the heart rates of nine animals were
   recorded while they were moving and while inactive on their home scars.
   Active limpets had a faster heart rate, 1.6 times that of limpets
   resting on their home scars. The dependence of heart rate on
   environmental temperature, size, respiratory medium and activity, as
   observed in limpets on the shore, agrees well with laboratory data and
   with previous findings of the correlation of oxygen consumption with the
   same factors. Such in situ measurements may, therefore, prove useful in
   attempts to determine natural levels of energy expenditure in models on
   the behaviour of foraging molluscs.}},

Abstract = {{Nocturnal patterns of activity by the New Zealand long-tailed bat
   (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) varied significantly in relation to habitat,
   season, time of night, temperature, and invertebrate activity. Automatic
   bat detection units recorded 12072 bat passes containing 593 feeding
   buzzes during 580 nights of sampling. Overall, 46.3\% of passes were
   along roads within forest, 42.7\% along forest edges, 8.1\% in open
   grassland and 2.9\% within forest. Pass rates averaged 30.8/night (95\%
   confidence interval (CI) = 23.3-38.4) during spring, 31.7 (CI =
   21.3-42.1) during summer, 6.7 (CI = 4.4-9.0) during autumn and 1.6 (CI =
   0.2-3.0) during winter. Bats were active throughout the night in all
   habitats, but the patterns of their activity were different in each.
   During spring and summer a significantly higher proportion of bat passes
   in edge and open habitats were recorded in the first 2 h after sunset,
   and activity then declined steadily towards dawn. In road habitats
   activity peaked in the second hour but was more consistent during the
   remaining hours of the night. Activity in forest did not vary through
   the night. Patterns were similar, though less pronounced, in autumn but
   in winter there was little activity during the first three hours after
   sunset or in the 5 h before dawn. Analysis of deviance models indicated
   that habitat, season, minimum overnight temperature, and invertebrate
   activity contributed to explaining the activities of bats. Overnight
   temperature was more important than invertebrate activity in explaining
   total bat activity in a night. Invertebrate activity was more
   significant than minimum temperature in the model explaining the amount
   of foraging activity per night, inferring that minimum temperature
   determines whether bats fly at night, while invertebrate activity
   determines how long bats feed. Techniques for indexing bat activity that
   are designed to survey distribution or monitor population trends should
   control for temporal variation and temperature to enable valid
   comparisons between counts.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed colonies of adult male and female Oriental cockroaches were
   conditioned to a 12:12h photocycle in arenas (0.23 m(2)) with a
   harbourage, food and water and then exposed to deposits (30 mg or 2 x 30
   mg) of 0.5 g kg(-1) fipronil gel bait at the beginning of a dark phase.
   The bait was rapidly consumed by the first sub-group of insects to
   emerge from the harbourage; any residual bait was removed from the
   arenas 4 h into the following light phase. Third-instar nymphs were then
   introduced and mortality was monitored over the subsequent 14 days with
   all cadavers left in situ. Death of cockroaches under these conditions
   was due to direct poisoning of the sub-group of the adults that consumed
   the bait and to secondary transfer of toxicity to the remainder of the
   adult and to the nymphal populations. Mean mortality in the adult
   populations increased to > 96\% (females) and > 53\% (males) with
   consistently higher mortality of females than males; that in the
   third-instar nymph (unexposed) populations increased to 25-50\%. Some
   cadavers were wholly or partially eaten by other cockroaches during this
   period, and this was interpreted as the major mechanism of secondary
   transfer of toxicity. Individual adult females were fed weighed bait
   deposits (10 mg) and, following death (24 h), the cadavers were
   transferred to closed containers held at 33\%, 52\% or 76\% relative
   humidity /28 degrees C for periods of up to 7 weeks. They were then
   added individually to groups of five adult females provided with water
   but no alternative food source. Mean mortalities (>64\% at 1 week and >
   96\% at 7 weeks) were not significantly lower than mean mortalities
   produced by freshly poisoned cockroaches, showing that no loss in the
   insecticidal activity of the cadavers occurred under these storage
   conditions. The potential of necrophagy to supplement the primary action
   of fipronil bait treatment of Oriental cockroach infestations by
   inhibiting colony redevelopment is discussed. (C) 2000 Society of

Abstract = {{Flight activity of Tabanus abactor Philip was monitored for five years
   from 1994 to 1998 on the Y Ranch in the Texas Rolling Plains. White
   bucket traps suspended 1 m above ground and brown board traps placed on
   the ground were coated with polyisobutlene to ensnare the flies. Study
   locations were confined to areas dominated by redberry juniper,
   Juniperus pinchoti Sudw. There were two activity cycles each year, but
   peak periods of activity were not consistent among years. In three
   years, the first peak occurred between mid- and late June, but in the
   other two years the first peak in numbers did not occur until after
   mid-July. Population trends were similar on the board and bucket traps,
   although board traps captured 60\% more flies than bucket traps. Fly
   numbers ranged from 14.0 to 66.3 per week on board traps in 1998 and
   1995, respectively. Correlation analyses indicated that numbers of flies
   captured on sticky traps were enhanced by rainfall and were suppressed
   by high temperatures.}},

Abstract = {{Tarnished plant bug (TPB), Lygus lineolaris (Palisot de Beauvois), is a
   key pest of cotton in many states. Although this pest can damage cotton
   throughout most of the growing season, economic damage is most likely to
   occur during the period from first square through early bloom due to
   feeding on small squares and subsequent abscission of these squares.
   During this period, excessive damage by high TPB populations may result
   in reduced yields or delayed maturity. However, current research
   suggests that cotton can tolerate low levels of TPB damage without
   sustaining yield loss. Most states recommend monitoring both numbers of
   insects and percent square retention in order to obtain information on
   which to base TPB management decisions. The relative importance of TPB
   as a key pest of cotton is increasing due to a number of changes in
   cotton insect management systems. These include: development of
   insecticide resistance in TPB, boil weevil eradication, transgenic Bt
   cotton, and the development and availability of more target-specific
   foliar-applied insecticides.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored breeding phenology and population levels of Rana
   yavapaiensis by use of repeated egg mass censuses and visual encounter
   surveys at Agua Caliente Canyon near Tucson, Arizona, from 1994 to 1996.
   Adult counts fluctuated erratically within each year of the study but
   annual means remained similar. Juvenile counts peaked during the fall
   recruitment season and fell to near zero by early spring. Rana
   yavapaiensis deposited eggs in two distinct annual episodes, one in
   spring (March-May) and a much smaller one in fall (September-October).
   Larvae from the spring deposition period completed metamorphosis in
   early summer. Over the two years of study, 96.6\% of egg masses
   successfully produced larvae. Egg masses were deposited during periods
   of predictable, moderate stream flow but not during seasonal periods
   when flash flooding or drought were likely to affect eggs or larvae.
   Breeding phenology of Rana yavapaiensis is particularly well suited for
   life in desert streams with natural flow regimes which include frequent
   flash flooding and drought at predictable times. The exotic predators of
   R yavapaiensis are less able to cope with fluctuating conditions.
   Unaltered stream flow regimes that allow natural fluctuations in stream
   discharge may provide refugia for this declining ranid frog from exotic
   predators by excluding those exotic species that are unable to cope with
   brief flash flooding and habitat drying.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses health risks to consumers due to the use of
   agricultural products irrigated with reclaimed wastewater. The analysis
   is based on a definition of an exposure model which takes into account
   several parameters: (1) the quality of the applied wastewater, (2) the
   irrigation method, (3) the elapsed times between irrigation, harvest,
   and product consumption, and (4) the consumers' habits. The exposure
   model is used for numerical simulation of human consumers' risks using
   the Monte Carlo simulation method. The results of the numerical
   simulation show large deviations, probably caused by uncertainty
   (impreciseness in quality of input data) and variability due to
   diversity among populations. There is a 10-orders of magnitude
   difference in the risk of infection between the different exposure
   scenarios with the same water quality. This variation indicates the need
   for setting risk-based criteria for wastewater reclamation rather than
   single water quality guidelines. Extra data are required to decrease
   uncertainty in the risk assessment. Future research needs to include
   definition of acceptable risk criteria, more accurate dose-response
   modeling, information regarding pathogen survival in treated wastewater,
   additional data related to the passage of pathogens into and in the
   plants during irrigation, and information regarding the behavior
   patterns of the community of human consumers.}},

Abstract = {{A free-living population of European rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus was
   monitored over three years, from 1996 to 1998, following the arrival of
   rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) in 1995. The survey was based on
   nocturnal observations of individually marked rabbits to determine
   population size and on blood collection to determine whether rabbits
   carried RHD antibodies. We directly confirmed RHD outbreaks by
   examination of dead rabbits and detection of RHD virus (RHDV). Only one
   further recurrence of RHD was detected by this method, in 1996. Contrary
   to the initial outbreak, this second occurrence did not result in a
   major decrease in population size. No direct evidence of other outbreaks
   was detected in 1997 and 1998. However, the sparse data did not enable
   us to conclude that RHD was absent. Indeed, seroconversions in
   individual rabbits were noticed throughout the three years and the level
   of population immunity remained high, proving that either RHDV or
   PHD-like viruses were present in the population. The influence of age,
   year and quarter on the serological status of the rabbits were analysed
   using a log-linear model. The selected model showed that the proportion
   of rabbits with RHD antibodies varied with year and period of the year.
   Three years after the first occurrence of RHD, the population had not
   recovered to its level prior to the first outbreak. We assumed that
   predation by red foxes could be partly responsible for keeping the
   population low.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a radio-telemetry study of translocated brown hares Lepus
   europaeus during March 1992 - November 1994 in a mid-elevation mountain
   site in central Italy. Of 44 hares released in the study area, 38 died
   during our field studies. Most hares (68.2\%) died within 10 days after
   release, 7.89\% died within 11-20 days, 2.63\% within 21-30 days and
   21.05\% later than 30 days after release. We found no difference in
   mortality rates between sexes. Most of the hares were preyed upon by red
   foxes Vulpes vulpes or beech marten Martes foina, but a few died of
   coccidiosis and various natural diseases. Some hares disappeared during
   the monitoring period. The average survival time was 52.7 days for males
   (N = 20), and 66.8 days for females (N = 21). We found no significant
   effect of sex, season or weight (g) on individual survival. Nearly all
   of the hares dispersed randomly from the release site within a radius of
   1,200 m. We found no significant effect of survival time on dispersal
   rates, nor did we find any significant intersexual difference in the
   maximum distances moved by translocated individuals. We did not observe
   this trend among females. Season, survival time and individual weight
   did not influence individual dispersal, whereas sex had a significant
   effect, as males tended to disperse farther than females.}},

Abstract = {{Pere David's deer (Elaphurus davidianus) was reintroduced to China after
   its extirpation in the country in the nineteenth century. The first
   reintroduction was made to the Beijing Milu Park in 1985 and the second
   to the Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve in 1986. Those reintroduction sites
   have different characteristics. The Beijing Milu Park is near a
   metropolitan region and has limited size, whereas the Dafeng Natural
   Reserve is located in a coastal region with little human settlement.
   Except for a nuclear breeding herd, the Pere David's deer of the Beijing
   Milu Park were shipped to other sites in eastern China to reduce the
   grazing pressure on the park vegetation and expand the distribution of
   Pere David's deer. The Dafeng Milu Natural Reserve has the potential to
   hold a large population of Pere David's deer ii more land were acquired
   to expand the natural reserve. By the end of 1997, total number of Pere
   David's deer in China reached 671, half of which were offspring from
   animals in Beijing Milu Park. The Beijing and Dafeng herds remain as 2
   of the largest Pere David's deer populations in China, the Beijing
   population accounting for 19\% and the Dafeng population for 45\% of the
   total population. Pi re David's deer of Beijing Milu Park have been
   transferred to 12 other locations. During 1987-1997, birth rates and net
   growth rates did not differ between populations (P=0.09 and P=0.74);
   however, death rates differed (P<0.01). After the period of adaptation,
   there was a period of population expansion, during which the birth rate
   in the Beijing and Dafeng populations declined as the population
   continued to grow. However, population density explained little about
   variation in birth rates in the Beijing and Dafeng populations; a
   longer-term monitoring of those populations is needed to assess
   plausible density-dependent population growth.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife managers in northwestern Colorado have had difficulty
   accurately estimating numbers of subadult male elk (Cervus elaphus) by
   sampling winter population densities and sex ratios. We investigated
   emigration and survival of telemetered 2-year-old male elk in a trophy
   hunting area in a northwestern Colorado Game Management Unit (GMU) to
   evaluate management strategies. We hypothesized that skewed numbers of
   males resulted from high subadult mortality or dispersal of subadult
   males, We used telemetered elk and Kaplan-Meier staggered entry methods
   to estimate emigration probability of 0.56 and 0.33 in 1995 and 1996,
   respectively. Maximum distances moved by emigrants from their capture
   point averaged 87 km (median=79+/-6.8 {[}SE]) in 1995 and 149 km
   (median=136+/-24.7) in 1996, Survival of emigrants was 0.25+/-0.07 for
   both years combined. Resident survival was greater in both years at
   0.89+/-0.05. Our results suggest that elk movement between management
   areas in northwest Colorado is prevalent. Losses of males from the
   2-year-old age cohort were attributed to high emigrant mortality and
   dispersal. Monitored elk dispersed throughout west-central Colorado and
   into parts of Utah and Wyoming. In addition, many harvested 2-year-old
   males had antlers that would have resulted in misclassification into
   older age categories by biologists during winter population surveys. We
   recommend conducting small-scale studies to identify local population
   dynamics, coordinate hunting seasons and population surveys, and align
   management boundaries with biological groups of elk.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat use and home range sizes of female Eastern Wild Turkeys
   (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) during preincubation may influence
   reproductive success. Little information on habitat selection during
   preincubation at multiple spatial scales is available and the influence
   of preincubation movement rates on reproductive success is poorly
   understood. We monitored 35 adult female Eastern Wild Turkeys during
   preincubation in central Mississippi during 1996-1997. We estimated home
   range and core area size, macrohabitat selection at multiple spatial
   scales and movement rates from 1 February until the beginning of
   incubation. Preincubation home ranges averaged 306.6 (+/-46.8 SE) ha and
   core areas 47.3 (+/-7.3) ha. Females selected 9-15 and 16-29 year-old
   pine (Pinus spp.) stands over other habitats available when establishing
   home ranges, but within these home ranges they selected pine stands that
   were older than 30 years for their core areas and nest sites. However,
   females used habitats within their established home range in proportion
   to availability. Movement rates averaged 286.5 (+/-22.3) m/hr during
   preincubation and were greater than during other seasons. We detected no
   correlations between home range or core area size and number of days
   nests were successfully incubated. However we detected a positive
   correlation between movement rates and increased incubation, suggesting
   females that moved farther during preincubation successfully incubated
   nests longer. Our findings suggest females selected habitats
   differentially when establishing pre-incubation home ranges and core
   areas. Further, our findings suggest movement rates within home ranges
   may better reflect a female's habitat sampling effort during nest site
   selection rather than home range or core area size.}},

Abstract = {{Relative abundance and habitat use of 29 forest bird species, including
   22 land birds (18 indigenous breeding residents, 3 exotics, 1 migrant)
   along with a rail, heron, and five seabirds (shearwater, tropicbird, 3
   terns) were assessed on Pohnpei {[}Island] during summer 1994 and
   compared with the results of the first survey in 1983. The most
   frequently encountered species in both surveys were the Purple-capped
   Fruit-Dove (Ptilinopus porphyraceus), Pohnpei Lory (Trichoglossus
   rubiginosus), Micronesian Starling (Aplonis opaca), and Micronesian
   Honeyeater (Myzomela rubratra). Among the five species endemic to
   Pohnpei, the Pohnpei Mountain Starling (Aplonis pelzelni) verges on
   extinction, with only one confirmed sighting in nearly 50 years; the
   Long-billed White-eye (Rukia longirostra) is vulnerable to encroaching
   agriculture in its preferred and limited montane habitat, where nearly
   90\% of the sightings were on approximately 10\% of the land area, and
   the Pohnpei Lory (Trichoglossus rubiginosus), Pohnpei Flycatcher
   (Myiagra pluto), and Pohnpei Fantail (Rhipidura kubaryl) are widespread
   and common, but were less frequently encountered in 1994 than in 1983.
   The total number of birds encountered per observation station during
   8-minute point counts in each of six elevation zones was 67-80\% fewer
   in 1994 than in 1983. Encounter rates (birds/hour) were reduced by at
   least 50\% in both uplands and lowlands in at least 14 of 29 species:
   none of the 29 showed an overall increase. Artifacts of sampling and
   sampling bias may have contributed to reduced observation rates, but
   anecdotal evidence suggests a decline in numbers is real and may be
   attributed to combined effects of habitat degradation, hunting
   practices, and possibly predation by introduced species. Protection of
   the upland forests from further degradation and more frequent monitoring
   to better assess population trends are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Imposer in muricid gastropods has been used to monitor tributyltin (TBT)
   contamination worldwide. Pollution was severe during the 1980s but
   regulations prohibiting the use of TBT-based antifoulants on vessels <
   25 m in length have been highly effective in reducing TBT levels in
   coastal waters. Large vessels are still sources of TBT and major ports,
   especially those with dry docking and repair facilities, continue to be
   hot-spots of contamination. Measures of imposer suggest that severe
   pollution is normally localised to within a few kilometres of them. Mild
   imposer, possibly as a result of TBT pollution (although other causes
   have not been ruled out), has been described in whelks Buccinum undatum
   from offshore waters of the southern and central North Sea. However, the
   species is still abundant there and the occurrence of imposer does not
   seem to have affected its breeding performance. Imposer was mild or
   absent in populations of dogwhelks from open oceanic sites around the
   north Atlantic Ocean, suggesting that the oceans are free of
   contamination at biologically significant levels. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Group housing of male laboratory mice often leads to welfare problems
   due to aggressive behaviour. From a welfare perspective, individual
   housing is not a preferred solution to these problems - and so we sought
   other ways of reducing aggression between male mice. Aggression peaks
   after disturbances such as cage cleaning. Transfer of olfactory cues
   during cage cleaning procedures has been repeatedly proposed as a means
   of reducing these peaks in aggression. In this study, the
   aggression-modulating properties of olfactory cues were studied by
   investigating the effects of their source and distribution on aggression
   after cage cleaning in groups of male BALB/c mice. The physiological
   effects of aggression on individuals within a group were also monitored.
   Our results indicated that neither kinship nor distribution of urine
   marks affected aggression. Olfactory cues from nesting and bedding
   material, however, affected aggression to a marked degree: transfer of
   nesting material reduced aggression significantly, while transfer of
   sawdust containing urine and faeces seemed to intensify, aggression.
   None of the physiological data revealed any differences between dominant
   and subordinate animals, nor any correlations with aggressiveness,
   except that dominant animals gained weight more rapidly than subordinate
   ones. We conclude that the transfer of nesting material will reduce
   aggression, or at least slow down its development, and thus aid the
   reduction of social tension due to cage cleaning.}},

Abstract = {{The research into the side effect of fungicides used in the control of
   the most serious disease in apples (Venturia inaequalis), i. e. the
   research into the influence of fungicides on the population of
   phytophagous mites, was carried out at Nedelisce (North-West Croatia)
   during 1997 and 1998. The study is related to the population of the
   mites most present in apple orchards, such as red spider mite
   (Pananychus ulmi) and other mites (Aculus schlechtendali and Tetranychus
   urticae). Fungicides which are known to be effective against scab, i. e.
   Venturia inaequalis, and used in fruit production in Croatia, were
   tested in order to investigate their secondary properties which have not
   yet been studied. The following fungicides were used: cyprodinil,
   dodine, dichlofluanid + bitertanol (as tank mix), and kresoxim-methyl.
   The tests were repeated three times; the application time was determined
   by monitoring the conditions for infection. The treatments were done
   curatively, i. e. up to 96 h after the onset of infection conditions.
   The mite population was estimated by the pressing method, which yielded
   the average number of mites per leaf. All the results were statistically
   processed by variance analysis and by Duncan's Multiple Range Test, and
   are presented graphically and in tables. The paper also presents
   graphically the climatic conditions, scab infections and application
   time. The research over two years have shown a pronounced suppressive
   effect of dichlofluanid + bitertanol on populations of phytophagous
   mites, while the other fungicides used in the research had a neutral
   effect on the mite papulation.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of monospecific algal diets on filtration rate (algal cells
   h(-1)) and fecundity of Mimachlamys asperrima was investigated.
   Filtration rates of seven algal species were monitored to indicate
   species preferences and to estimate maximum daily filtration rates.
   Cells of Chaetoceros calcitrans and Pavlova lutheri were filtered most
   rapidly; however, on a cell weight (mg h(-1)) and cell volume (mu L
   h(-1)) basis, scallops filtered more Rhodomonas salina and Tetraselmis
   chui from the water column. Filtration rates when fed the diatom
   Chaetoceros muelleri were the lowest of the tested species, with a
   relatively low weight and volume of the algae filtered. Maximum
   filtration rates of the tested species were estimated to vary between
   2.25 x 10(9) and 7.68 x 10(9) cells scallop(-1) day(-1). Filtration of
   algal species by M. asperrima varied in accordance with both scallop
   size and water temperature. Five of the seven algal species previously
   tested were then selected for use as monoalgal diets for female M.
   asperrima and fed for 4 weeks. Fecundity of scallops after this
   treatment did not necessarily reflect filtration rates, being greatest
   for scallops fed C. muelleri, which was significantly greater than that
   of the scallops fed C. calcitrans. Percentage development of eggs to
   D-veliger larvae did not differ in accordance with the maternal diet. A
   combined diet of C. muelleri, P. lutheri and Tahitian Isochrysis aff.
   galbana averaging approximate to 2.5 x 10(9) cells scallop(-1) day(-1)
   was found to be suitable for the maintenance and conditioning of M.
   asperrima broodstock in recirculating systems.}},

Abstract = {{Aquatic insects are an important component of the food web in salt
   marshes, therefore it is necessary to test whether pesticides used to
   control mosquitoes in salt marshes are safe for nontarget insects. We
   tested the nontarget effects of a combined formulation (duplex) of
   Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (B.t.i.) and liquid methoprene (an
   insect development regulator) or sustained-release methoprene pellets
   (Altosid(R) pellets) by applying these materials to replicated salt
   marsh ponds at maximum label rates. Untreated ponds served as controls.
   We measured effects of the pesticides by rearing immature mosquitoes
   (Aedes dorsalis) and water boatmen (Trichocorixa reticulata) in
   predator-exclusion cages and by monitoring uncaged populations of
   invertebrates using replicated sweep-net samples. Both pesticides killed
   caged mosquitoes, and the activity of the Altosid(R) pellets continued
   through 99 days. There were no detectable effects of either pesticide on
   the survival or maturation of T. reticulata, or on abundances of uncaged
   invertebrates. The long-term activity of the pellets could help minimize
   mosquito abatement activity in salt marshes where there are breeding
   birds or endangered species. However, other studies suggest that this
   advantage needs to be balanced against the risks that sustained-release
   formulations could lead to development of resistance in mosquitoes or
   that initially undetected nontarget effects could build over time.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the habitats used by an introduced species of
   rodent, the black rat Rattus rattus (Linnaeus), at North Head in New
   South Wales, Australia. At a coarse scale, combined live-trapping and
   radio-tracking indicated that animals used forest proportionately more
   than open, heath or scrub macrohabitats that were available. To identify
   the components contributing to this pattern, microhabitat use was
   assessed by scoring vegetative and structural features around trap
   stations, and by using spool-and-line tracking. The results indicated
   that rats preferred microhabitats providing a deep cover of leaf litter
   and dense understorey with numerous vertical stems. As statistical
   analysis did not distinguish which of these components was more
   important in determining habitat use, we designed an experiment to test
   the importance of a single component: leaf litter. Cover of litter was
   enhanced experimentally at 75 trap stations and reduced at 75 others,
   and the response of rats monitored by live-trapping on two occasions.
   Although no clear response was found in the first run of the experiment,
   due to low numbers, rats strongly selected trap stations with enhanced
   leaf litter in the second run. These results indicate that litter cover
   affects use of habitat by the black rat. Access to food resources and
   avoidance of predators may contribute to the observed local patterns of
   abundance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the assessment of silver European eel (Anguilla
   anguilla) escapement based on a ``sedentary{''} population fraction
   analysis in a 60-km(2) watershed of northern Brittany (France).
   Downstream migration fluxes were monitored using eel traps and related
   to environmental factors. Intensive electrofishing and fyke-net fishing
   were conducted to assess eel biomass, densities, and population
   structure. A total of 564 eels, including 81 silver eels, were PIT
   tagged. In 1996, 616 eels were caught in the catchment including 68
   silver eels (11\%). During the following downstream migration period, 12
   of the PIT-tagged silver eels, among a total of 678, were recaptured in
   the downstream traps. Seven were recaptured in the catchment in 1997. It
   was shown that (i) only about 20\% of the silver eels present in the
   catchment emigrated during the following year, (ii) 12\% stayed in the
   catchment including two (3.4\%) that recovered yellow eel
   characteristics, and (iii) the other eels either died or settled in the
   catchment but were not recaptured. It was also estimated that 2\% (650
   eels) of the population (34 000 eels) among 3000 silver eels considered
   ``emigration candidates{''} emigrated each year.}},

Abstract = {{We examined whether arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryii
   plesius) populations in northern boreal forest in the Yukon Territory,
   Canada, were limited by food, predators, or a combination of both,
   during the decline and low phases of a snowshoe hare cycle. From 1990 to
   1995, populations were monitored in large-scale (1 km(2)) experimental
   manipulations. Squirrels were studied on eight 9-ha grids: four
   unmanipulated control grids, two food-supplemented grids, a
   predator-exclosure grid, and a predator-exclosure + food-supplemented
   grid. Population density was measured on all grids by livetrapping and
   active-season survival was measured using radiotelemetry. Population
   densities were lowest in 1992 and 1993 (2 years after the snowshoe hare
   population decline). Rates of population change were negative from 1991
   to 1993, when predation pressure was most intense after the snowshoe
   hare decline, and positive from 1993 to 1995, when hares and predators
   were at low densities. Predation accounted for 125 of 130 mortalities
   (96\%) of radio-collared squirrels. Adult survival was significantly
   lower in 1992 and 1993 than in 1994 and 1995, and was a strong predictor
   of annual rates of population change in arctic ground squirrels.
   Treatments were ranked as follows in their effect on adult survival:
   predator exclosure + food-supplemented > food-supplemented > predator
   exclosure > controls. Juvenile survival was lowest in 1992, and food
   addition and predator removal separately increased juvenile survival. On
   average, predator exclusion increased population densities twofold, food
   supplementation increased densities fourfold, and food supplementation
   and predator removal together increased densities 10-fold. We conclude
   that food and predation interact to limit arctic ground squirrel
   populations in the boreal forest during the decline and low phases of
   the snowshoe hare cycle. The snowshoe hare cycle may indirectly create a
   lagged secondary fluctuation in arctic ground squirrel populations
   through shared cyclic predators.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological segregation of species is difficult to determine using
   conventional dietary analysis techniques. However, stable-isotope
   analysis may provide a convenient means of establishing trophic
   segregation of species and of groups of animals within a species in the
   same area. We measured stable carbon (delta(13)C) and nitrogen
   (delta(15)N) isotope values in hair of black bears (Ursus americanus)
   and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) inhabiting the upper Columbia River
   basin in southeastern British Columbia, together with samples of
   potential foods ranging from plant material through invertebrates and
   ungulate meat. We found extensive overlap in both delta(15)N and
   delta(13)C values of hair from male grizzly bears and black bears of
   both sexes. Female grizzly bears, however, had lower delta(15)N values
   in their hair than the other groups of bears, indicating either less
   animal protein in their diet or a reliance on foods more depleted in
   N-15, possibly related to altitude. Our isotopic model generally
   confirmed a herbivorous diet for both bear species (a mean estimated
   plant contribution of 91\%). Bears showing the highest delta(15)N values
   were those captured because they posed a management problem. We suggest
   that the slope of the relationship between tissue delta(15)N and
   delta(13)C values might provide a convenient means of evaluating the
   occurrence of consumption of animal protein in populations, regardless
   of local isotopic end-points for dietary samples. We examined three
   black bear cubs from dens and found them to be about a trophic level
   higher than adult females, reflecting their dependence on mother's milk,
   a result generally confirmed by an analysis of eight mother-cub pairs
   from Minnesota. Our study demonstrates how stable-isotope analysis of
   bear tissue can be used to monitor the feeding habits of populations, as
   well as provide dietary histories that may reveal dietary
   specializations among individuals.}},

Abstract = {{The responses of a herd of migratory woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus
   caribou) to timber harvesting that fragmented about 11\% of their winter
   range in west-central Alberta were examined in this study. From 1981 to
   1996, 45 caribou were radio-collared and monitored during the initiation
   and completion of first-pass timber harvest (50\% removal). Variables
   examined were home-range size, daily movement rates, and distance to the
   nearest cut block for radio-collared individuals. Daily movement rates
   and individual winter range sizes decreased as timber harvesting
   progressed. Caribou avoided using recently fragmented areas by an
   average of 1.2 km. If fragmentation of the winter range continues
   through timber harvesting and other industrial activities, the ``spacing
   out{''} antipredator strategy used by caribou may be compromised. Based
   on these findings, timber-harvesting strategies are recommended that (i)
   ensure an adequate area of usable habitat to support the current
   population, (ii) minimize the amount of fragmented area, and (iii) in
   the short term avoid presently defined core use areas.}},

Abstract = {{I tape-recorded and counted the songs of color-banded Golden-cheeked
   Warblers (Dendroica chrysoparia) on Fort Hood, Texas in 1993 and 1994 to
   determine whether males use a two-category song system common to many
   wood-warbler species. More than 97\% of all songs I documented belonged
   to two categories: A and B. A songs were higher in frequency, shorter,
   less complex, and were delivered at lower rates than B songs. Males used
   A songs primarily early in the nesting season, when near females, and
   from the interior of territories. In contrast, B songs were more common
   later in the nesting season, at dawn, and when males sang near territory
   boundaries. Songs delivered near territory edges were usually sung from
   one or two preferred perches on each male's territory that often
   coincided with the edge of a cliff or a break in the forest canopy.
   Based on these data, and in contrast to the implications of an early
   account of Golden-cheeked Warbler song use, this species shares the song
   system used by many wood-warbler species. Furthermore, the patterns of
   song use that I observed suggest that males do not sing randomly with
   respect to time or location on territory, and monitoring efforts that
   assume random singing across time and space may result in inaccurate or
   biased estimates of population sizes and habitat preferences.}},

Abstract = {{The 1994 amendments to the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act required,
   for the first time, an assessment of the status of every marine mammal
   stock in the United States. We draw conclusions about the status of
   marine mammals from assessments of 153 stocks conducted to meet the
   requirements of these amendments. We found important regional
   differences in the status of stocks. Most stocks in the Atlantic and
   Pacific experience human-induced mortality (takes), primarily from
   gill-net fisheries. The proportion of stocks with takes was lower in the
   Gulf of Mexico and Hawaii, areas with few gill-net fisheries. Estimated
   takes exceeded removal limits for 29\% of stocks in the Atlantic, 14\%
   in the Pacific, 8\% in Alaska, 7\% in the Gulf of Mexico, and 0\% in
   Hawaii. Twenty-eight stocks are listed as threatened or endangered under
   the U.S. Endangered Species Act. Most, but not all, baleen whale stocks
   are recovering after cessation of commercial harvests. Many species of
   pelagic cetaceans, including beaked and sperm whales, are vulnerable to
   mortality in pelagic drift-net fisheries. Most pinniped stocks
   experience takes, but none of these takes exceeds removal limits, and
   all pinniped stocks on mainland coasts of the United States are
   increasing in abundance. Quantitative data on trends in abundance are
   available for few cetacean stocks, emphasizing the difficulty of
   monitoring trends in these species. These stock assessments have greatly
   advanced our understanding of the status of marine mammals in the United
   States, but information gaps remain, particularly regarding stock
   structure and possible mortality in unmonitored fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{The world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita (Phocoena
   sinus), continues to be caught in small-mesh gillnet fisheries
   throughout much of its range. We monitored fishing effort and incidental
   vaquita mortality in the upper Gulf of California, Mexico, from January
   1993 to January 1995 to study the magnitude and causes of the incidental
   take. Of those factors studied, including net mesh size, soaktime, and
   geographic area, none contributed significantly to the incidental
   mortality rate of the vaquita, implying that the principal cause of
   mortality is fishing with gillnets per se. The total estimated
   incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara was
   39 vaquitas per year (95\% CI = 14, 93), over 17\% of the most recent
   estimate of population size. El Golfo de Santa Clara is one of three
   main ports that support gillnet fisheries throughout the range of the
   vaquita. Preliminary results indicate that fishing effort for San
   Felipe, Baja California, is comparable to that of El Golfo de Santa
   Clara, suggesting that this estimate of incidental mortality of vaquitas
   represents a minimum. We strongly recommend a complete and permanent ban
   on gillnets in the area. Alternative or supplemental mitigation
   strategies include (1) a maximum annual allowable mortality limit of
   vaquitas; (2) mandatory observer coverage of all boats fishing within
   the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta Biosphere Reserve;
   (3) extension of the Upper Gulf of California and Colorado River Delta
   Biosphere Reserve to encompass all known vaquita habitat; (4) rigorous
   enforcement of new and existing regulations; and (5) development of
   alternative sources of income for gillnet fishers.}},

Abstract = {{The prevailing fragmentation paradigm predicts that large, intact
   forests are acting as population sources for Neotropical migrant
   landbirds. We used the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as a model for
   evaluating the role Great Smoky Mountains National Park (the largest
   national park in the eastern United States) may play in maintaining
   regional songbird populations. We estimated the annual productivity of
   Wood Thrushes in the park by combining observations on the birds'
   distribution, abundance, and productivity with estimates of habitat
   availability. We estimated a breeding population of approximately 10,000
   nesting pairs using habitat models developed from over 2500 point-count
   censuses conducted across the park. Data from 426 nests monitored from
   1992 to 1997 produced a daily nest survival rate of 0.96. We estimated
   an annual fecundity of 2.76 fledglings per breeding pair, based on a
   model that incorporated the re-nesting behavior of Wood Thrushes.
   Results indicate that the park is producing approximately 3000 surplus
   female young each year. Daily nest survival rates were below those
   reported in other studies of Wood Thrushes in large forest tracts. The
   relatively high productivity of 3.31 nestlings per successful nest
   suggests that, in the absence of predation, the park provides
   high-quality nesting habitat for Wood Thrushes, but that it may also
   support a more diverse and abundant predator community than more
   disturbed or less contiguous sites. The difficulties of estimating the
   size of continental breeding bird populations make assessing the
   significance of the park within a regional landscape context
   problematic, but our estimates suggest that, although the park is
   functioning as a substantial population source on a local scale, its
   potential to sustain regional or continental Wood Thrush populations is
   limited. Our findings suggest that species such as the Wood Thrush are
   capable of moderate levels of surplus productivity in high-quality
   habitat, but that extensive areas of suitable habitat outside protected
   areas and other public lands will be required to sustain continental
   breeding populations.}},

Abstract = {{Deer densities in forests of eastern North America are thought to have
   significant effects on the abundance and diversity of forest birds
   through the role deer play in structuring forest understories. We tested
   the ability of deer to affect forest bird populations by monitoring the
   density and diversity of vegetation and birds for 9 years at eight 4-ha
   sites in northern Virginia, four of which were fenced to exclude deer.
   Both the density and diversity of understory woody plants increased
   following deer exclosure. The numerical response of the shrubs to deer
   exclosure was significantly predicted by the soil quality (ratio of
   organic carbon to nitrogen) at the sites. Bird populations as a whole
   increased following exclosure of deer, particularly for ground and
   intermediate canopy species. The diversity of birds did not increase
   significantly following exclosure of deer, however, primarily because of
   replacement of species as understory vegetation proceeded through
   successional processes. Changes in understory vegetation accounted for
   most of the variability seen in the abundance and diversity of bird
   populations. Populations of deer in protected areas are capable of
   causing significant shifts in the composition and abundance of bird
   communities. These shifts can be reversed by increasing the density and
   diversity of understory vegetation, which can be brought about by
   reducing deer density.}},

Title = {{Threats to US public lands from cumulative hydrologic alterations
   outside of their boundaries}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{971-989}},

Abstract = {{U.S. public lands are increasingly threatened by human alteration of
   hydrologic connections outside their boundaries. Cumulative effects of
   dams, impoundments, regulated flows, wetlands drainage, and groundwater
   extraction outside of public land boundaries can play a key role in
   controlling the hydrology and biology within these managed areas.
   Expanding human populations require more water, and they often look to
   public lands to meet their demands. Immediate challenges facing water
   resource managers are increased pressure to dam rivers and pump aquifers
   near public lands, as a result of water shortages exacerbated by
   droughts coupled with increased demands from municipal and agricultural
   growth. As pollutants become more concentrated in less water, water
   quality often becomes a major related issue. While these problems are
   particularly acute in rapidly growing regions of the arid West where
   water is severely limited, they are also emerging in the East.
   Data on cumulative effects of hydrologic alterations on the biological
   integrity of public lands have not been systematically assessed at a
   national level. However, emerging trends can be used to gauge the
   magnitude of outside pressures and to place water resource challenges
   into context. The U.S. National Park Service is participating in water
   rights adjudications in over 50 different park service units. The U.S.
   Forest Service currently has over 500 legal claims concerning water
   rights for national forests located in 55 basins of 11 Western states.
   Similar conflicts exist for national wildlife refuges which are
   particularly vulnerable to water quality and quantity problems because
   of their small size; in 1994, 150 out of 224 Western wildlife refuges
   reported conflicts with other water users, and only 98 reported that
   their existing water rights assured delivery of adequate water in an
   average year.
   As human demands for water continue to expand, financially strapped
   federal land management agencies have a greater need for strengthened
   institutional, legal, and scientific tools to manage hydrologic
   connections. Two case studies from different biogeographic extremes
   (Stillwater National Wildlife Refuge in the arid Nevada desert and the
   Caribbean National Forest in the wet tropics of Puerto Rico) illustrate
   the synergism that can occur between field managers and scientists in
   implementing localized solutions. Moreover, they highlight the critical
   need to address cumulative long-term effects of hydrologic alterations
   outside of public land boundaries. Recommendations include:
   establishment of more stream gaging stations and monitoring programs
   within and adjacent to public lands; development of new and innovative
   partnerships between federal land management agencies and both federal
   and academic scientists; and interdisciplinary research and development
   of science-based tools to predict cumulative and interactive effects of
   hydrologic alterations.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives of this study were to distinguish demographic source and
   sink habitats of Red-winged Blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) and to
   determine the factors influencing source-sink status prior to fledging.
   In Boulder County, Colorado, I monitored 591 nests between 1995 and 1997
   in breeding habitats that were either natural (wetlands, tallgrass
   prairie) or anthropogenic (hayfields, roadside ditches). To determine
   source-sink status, I calculated the productivity necessary to offset
   mortality. Predation was the main determinant of source-sink status,
   while brood parasitism had virtually no impact on this population.
   Anthropogenic habitats consistently functioned as sinks throughout the
   three year study. Sources occurred only in natural habitats, and source
   sites had fewer buildings nearby than did sinks. In addition, climate
   variability may have influenced reproduction by influencing egg-laying
   dates. In 1995, possible source habitats;included tallgrass prairie and
   wetlands. In 1996, tallgrass prairie functioned as a strong source, but
   in 1997 none of the natural habitats functioned as sources. The Boulder
   suburban area appeared to function as a regional sink during this study,
   possibly because human activity attracts high densities of
   human-commensal predators such as raccoons and corvids that depredate
   Red-winged Blackbird nests.}},

Abstract = {{We surveyed larval amphibians and fish in 25 relatively pristine
   depression wetlands on the upper Atlantic coastal plain of South
   Carolina to examine relationships among hydroperiod length, fish
   presence/absence and larval amphibian assemblage structure. Our goals
   were to test the application of general models of lentic community
   structure to Southeastern depression wetlands and to develop
   expectations of larval amphibian assemblage structure at reference
   sites. Amphibian species richness showed a unimodal pattern along a
   hydroperiod gradient, with wetlands that contained water for 8-10 mo/yr
   having the highest species richness. Wetlands that contained water for
   longer periods (i.e., dried only during severe drought) often contained
   fish and had relatively low amphibian species richness. Most species
   occurred along a restricted portion of the hydroperiod gradient, and
   some species were found almost exclusively in wetlands with fish.
   Associations among the occurrence of species led to relatively discrete
   breaks in assemblage structure along the hydroperiod gradient. Canonical
   correspondence analysis of catch-per-unit-effort data identified four
   groups of wetlands with similar assemblage structure: (1) short (drying
   in spring), (2) medium (drying in summer), and (3) long (drying in fall
   or semi-annually) hydroperiod wetlands without fish; and (4) long
   hydroperiod wetlands with fish. Our results suggest that general models
   of community structure in lentic systems are applicable to southeastern
   isolated wetlands and should form the basis for developing expectations
   of larval amphibian assemblage structure in these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Seven accessions or varieties of cultivated pea Pisum sativum L. varying
   in surface waxbloom characteristics were grown in replicated small plots
   (1 m(2)) for two seasons to monitor natural infestations of insect
   herbivores and abundance of predatory insects. Waxbloom was quantified
   on the basis of the amount of waxes extractable from leaf surfaces;
   densities of wax crystals visible with scanning electron microscopy, and
   visual appearance During each season, pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum
   (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphidae), densities per plant were significantly
   lower on peas with reduced surface waxbloom as compared with peas with
   standard or `normal' surface waxbloom. This difference was greatest
   between two near-isolines of peas differing in expression of a mutation
   that reduces surface waxes. Although reduced-waxbloom plants had lower
   end-of-season above ground biomass and vine lengths, including these
   variables as covariates did not affect the significance of the waxbloom
   effects on aphid densities. Damage to leaves and stipules by the pea
   leaf weevil Sitona lineatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was greater
   on reduced-waxbloom peas than normal-waxbloom peas. Thus, as occurs in
   other crops, reduced waxbloom in peas is associated with lower natural
   infestations of an aphid, but also with increased susceptibility to a
   folivorous beetle. Populations of predatory coccinellids did not differ
   consistently between years on reduced-waxbloom versus normal-waxbloom
   peas, failing to support a hypothesis that predator populations are
   higher on reduced waxbloom peas,contributing to the lower aphid
   populations on these plants.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effects of chronic exposure to radionuclides, primarily
   uranium and mixed-fission products, on cancer mortality in a
   retrospective cohort study of workers enrolled in the
   radiation-monitoring program of a nuclear research and development
   facility. Between 1950 and 1994, 2,297 workers were monitored for
   internal radiation exposures, and 441 workers died, 134 (30.4\%) of them
   from cancer as the underlying cause. We calculated internal lung-dose
   estimates based on urinalysis and whole-body and lung counts reported
   for individual workers. We examined cancer mortality of workers exposed
   at different cumulative lung-dose levels using complete risk-set
   analysis for cohort data, adjusting for age, pay type, Lime since first
   radiation monitored, and external radiation. Tn addition, we examined
   the potential for confounding due to chemical exposures and smoking,
   explored whether external radiation exposure modifies the effects of
   internal exposure, and estimated effects after excluding exposures
   likely to have been unrelated to disease onset. Dose-response relations
   were observed for death from hemato- and lymphopoietic cancers and from
   upper aerodigestive tract cancers, adjusting for age, rime since first
   monitored, pay type, and external (gamma) radiation dose. No association
   was found for other cancers, including cancers of the lung. Despite the
   small number of exposed deaths from specific cancer types and possible
   bias due to measurement error and confounding, the positive findings and
   strong dose-response gradients observed suggest carcinogenic effects of
   internal radiation to the upper aerodigestive tract and the blood and
   lymph system in this occupational cohort. However, causal inferences
   require replication of our results in other populations or confirmation
   with an extended follow-up of this cohort.}},

   population of 15,460. Until 1989, the main land use was forestry and
   sheep grazing. There is a high biodiversity of flora. represented by
   1400 species. including many indigenous of the Balkan Peninsula. Very
   important also is the ornithological value of the mountain, which has
   been included in the European Union (EU) Network of Special Protection
   Areas. Although nature conservation and traditional land use are in a
   balance, recent studies have concluded that several parts of the
   mountain should be designated for protection and that conservation
   measures should be undertaken for others. This stemmed from the concern
   that degradation of the environment may occur, because there has been an
   attempt during the last decade to develop the area for multiple land
   use, especially tourism. Before designation, the main action has been
   the preparation of a three-ministerial resolution, which provides for
   protection zones and for specific measures, in order to regulate the
   existing and future activities. Additionally, the production of
   management plans and monitoring for environmental changes has been of

Abstract = {{The usefulness of birds as bioindicators of mining and pastoral impacts
   at Olympic Dam in arid South Australia was assessed. Bioindicators were
   considered to be most important for detecting early signs of
   landscape-scale impacts. Therefore, bird populations were monitored near
   but not in the immediate vicinity of a recently established mine and
   processing plant and near a number of pastoral waterpoints, most of
   which had only been grazed for 4 years at the commencement of this
   study. The abundance of ail bird species recorded on fixed transects in
   mining, pastoral, and control regions from 1992-1995 were compared in
   generalized linear models in conjunction with the effects of a range of
   habitat and disturbance variables.
   Significant annual variations in population size of most species were
   evident with greater abundance of most species in wet years. Habitat
   variables, particularly vegetation structure. were also an important
   determinant of the abundance of most bird species and tended to mask the
   impacts of the land use under investigation. Several bird species had
   benefited from the provision of permanent water at mining and pastoral
   sites. Other species utilized increased nesting or feeding opportunities
   associated with the mining operation and increased food supply at the
   pastoral sites. Crested bellbirds and mixed-feeding flocks of small
   insectivorous birds were apparently disadvantaged by mining and hence
   may be useful bioindicators of mining impacts. No bird species or
   community parameters were identified which could serve as useful early
   warning bioindicators of pastoral impacts.}},

Abstract = {{Trajectory analysis shows that the air masses arriving at Riverside, CA,
   on the afternoons of September 24 and 25, 1996, previously passed near
   air monitoring sites at Santa Catalina Island, Long Beach, and
   Fullerton, CA, in succession. At those sites, electrical aerosol
   analyzers and optical particle counters acquired continuous particle
   size distribution data, inertial impactor and bulk filter samples were
   taken with 4-h time resolution for determination of particle size and
   chemical composition during intensive sampling periods once per day at
   each site, and aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometers acquired
   continuous data on particle size and composition at the single-particle
   level. These data permit particle evolution to be studied within single
   air masses as they sequentially pass several monitoring sites over a
   2-day period. Air parcels associated with both of the trajectories
   studied show mineral dust, organic carbon, particulate nitrate and
   ammonium, and total suspended particulate matter concentrations that
   increase as transport occurs across the air basin. Large increases in
   particulate ammonium and nitrate concentrations occur between Fullerton
   and Riverside due to overnight air stagnation in an area with high
   gaseous ammonia emissions. The aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometers
   show how the externally mixed population of individual particles is
   modified chemically during transport from Long Beach to Riverside, CA.
   The coastal aerosol at Long Beach containing sea-salt particles and
   primary carbon particles is changed substantially as these particles
   individually accumulate secondary ammonium nitrate and organics during
   travel across the air basin.}},

Abstract = {{At radioactive sites, at least two mechanisms may affect the genetic
   diversity of populations of a given species. Increased mutation rates
   due to radiation exposure may increase the amount of genetic diversity
   in a population. Alternatively, population bottlenecks exacerbated by
   environmental degradation may lead to a reduction of diversity. The
   relationship between these two contradictory forces is complex. To
   explore this relationship, long-term monitoring of a genetic marker
   within a population is needed. To provide baseline data on the
   population genetics of the bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) living in
   the most contaminated regions at Chornobyl, Ukraine, we have sequenced
   291 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA control region. Bank voles were
   chosen as a model system because they have the highest levels of
   internal dose of cesium-134, cesium-137, and strontium-90 within the
   Chornobyl exclusion zone. We sampled three geographic sites, which were
   Oranoe, a reference site with virtually no radioactive contamination (<2
   Ci/km(2)), and two highly contaminated sites, Glyboke Lake and the Red
   Forest (both 1,000 Ci/km(2)). Genetic diversity in the population from
   Red Forest (0.722 +/- 0.024) was significantly greater than at the
   Oranoe reference site (0.615 +/- 0.039), while genetic diversity at
   Glyboke Lake (0.677 +/- 0.068) was intermediate. It is concluded that
   long-term studies of historical and demographic characteristics for
   experimental and reference populations are required in order to employ
   population genetics to understand the biological impact of environmental
   contaminants on the genetics of natural populations.}},

Abstract = {{Yearly variations in catchability were analysed in a long-term
   electrofishing monitoring programme aimed at determining juvenile salmon
   densities. The mean catchability for both fry (age 0+) and parr (age
   greater than or equal to 1+) was significantly lower during the later
   nine years of the 18-year data set, without surround nets, than during
   the first nine years when surround nets were used. Some changes in the
   sampling technique were introduced between the periods, which impacted
   on the catchability. The catchability decreased with parr density, but
   the predictability of the regression between the density and the
   catchability was weak. The mean catchability over the years and sampling
   sites was as high as over 0.4 for fry and over 0.5 for parr which
   fulfilled the general criteria of proper population estimation. A
   three-removal electrofishing technique is considered adequately precise
   for a long-term monitoring. The crew should consist of experienced
   members and the sampling procedure should be as standardised and
   consistent as possible. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In 1993, the Fallingsnow Ecosystem Project was initiated in northwestern
   Ontario to assess the effects of alternative conifer release practices
   on ecosystem processes, wildlife populations, and spruce production.
   Conifer release treatments: two herbicide (glyphosate and triclopyr),
   two cutting treatments (brushsaw and Silvana selective mower), and
   controls were established on four 30-60 ha clearcut and planted (spruce)
   blocks. Unharvested controls adjacent to each block constituted a sixth
   treatment. Objectives of this study were: (1) to quantify soil
   nitrification rates for the control, glyphosate, brushsaw, and
   unharvested forest treatments and (2) to relate these rates to soil
   temperature and moisture. Weather stations and buried
   fiberglass/resistance soil cells were established in 1994 to monitor
   soil temperatures and moisture. During the second posttreatment growing
   season (1995), soil samples were collected at 5, 15, and 30 cm depth and
   incubated in polyethylene bags at the same depth from which they were
   collected for 30 days prior to exhumation. The above procedure was
   repeated for the months of June, July, August, and September. In the
   third posttreatment growing season (1996), bags were buried (mid-June,
   mid-July mid-august) at 5 cm only and exhumed 30 days after burial.
   Higher levels of nitrate (NO3-) were observed for the glyphosate and
   brushsaw treatments in August 1995 compared with the control and
   unharvested forest treatments. Rates (mu g 100 g(-1) dry soil per day)
   of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate production decreased with soil depth and
   exhibited a distinctive seasonal trend, decreasing as soil temperatures
   declined. Ammonium production was significantly correlated with soil
   temperature and moisture, increasing with increasing temperature, and
   decreasing at higher moisture levels. By the third (1996) posttreatment
   growing season, no treatment-related differences were observed, and
   ammonium production was less correlated with soil temperature than
   during the second (1995) posttreatment growing season. These results
   affirm that application of glyphosate is the best option evaluated for
   effective weed control and optimal-nutrient release. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A field experiment was established to examine the effects of temperature
   and moisture modifications on the nematode fauna of a semiarid
   grassland. Several combinations of drying, wetting, warming and cooling
   were applied to plots and compared with untreated control plots. The
   experiment was performed from July to October 1996. A significant shift
   was observed in the structure of the nematode fauna between late summer
   and early autumn. This shift was manifested in the disappearance of four
   rare genera; Ecumenicus, Eucephalobus, Paraphelenchus and Pungentus. A
   significant decrease was found in the density of Acrobeles,
   Aphelenchoides, Ditylenchus and Prismatolaimus; in addition there was a
   significant increase in the density of Cephalobus, Helicotylenchus,
   Paratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus. Community structural change was
   represented by an initial decrease in nematode generic richness of
   30-50\%, and in a statistically significant decrease of nematode
   diversity in the control and all treated plots. Thereafter, emergence of
   a new community was demonstrated. Data show that temperature
   manipulation was the main factor to influence nematode diversity,
   Maturity Index, and Plant Parasite Index. However, nematode population
   density was influenced predominantly by the soil moisture content.
   Coenological analysis of soil nematode fauna appears to be a useful tool
   for the biological monitoring of the effects of global change on
   semiarid grasslands.}},

   et al. 1995). Also, organizations such as the Conference of Radiation
   Control Program Directors (CRCPD) the National Council on Radiation
   Protection and Measurements (NCRP) and the Electric Power Research
   Institute (EPRT) have published recommendations on this subject (CRCPD
   1995; NCRP 1995; EPRI 1998). Before implementing the use of any of the
   proposed relationships, they should be thoroughly reviewed so that
   proper practices ale chosen and monitoring data are properly evaluated.
   It is also important for each facility to be aware of the regulatory
   requirements in their state such as if the methodology is approved for
   use, which method and for whom can the EDE be applied. The United States
   Nuclear Regulatory Agency (NRC) does not currently permit dose weighting
   for any of its licensees. The EPRI study performed in 1997 was initiated
   by the NRC to determine how viable dose weighting would be, and for
   which NRC licensee population. This paper discusses numerical
   relationships for external exposure in diagnostic radiology for
   estimating EDE in a single-monitor program.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater tidal estuaries comprise the most upstream reaches of
   estuaries and are often characterised by the presence of dense bacterial
   and algal populations which provide a large food source for
   bacterivorous and algivorous protists. In 1996, the protistan community
   in the freshwater tidal reaches of the Schelde estuary was monitored to
   evaluate whether these high food levels are reflected in a similarly
   high heterotrophic protistan biomass. Protistan distribution patterns
   were compared to those of metazoan zooplankton to evaluate the possible
   role of top-down regulation of protists by metazoans. Apart from the
   algivorous sarcodine Asterocaelum, which reached high densities in
   summer, heterotrophic protistan biomass was dominated by ciliates and,
   second in importance, heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNAN). HNAN
   abundance was low (annual average 2490 cells ml(-)1) and did not display
   large seasonal variation. It is hypothesised that HNAN were top-down
   controlled by oligotrich ciliates throughout the year and by rotifers in
   summer. Ciliate abundance was generally relatively high (annual average
   65 cells ml(-)1) and peaked in winter (maximum 450 cells ml(-)1). The
   decline of ciliate populations in summer was ascribed to grazing by
   rotifers, which developed dense populations in that season. In winter,
   ciliate populations were probably regulated `internally' by carnivorous
   ciliates (haptorids and Suctoria). Our observations suggest that, in
   this type of productive ecosystems, the microbial food web is mainly
   top-down controlled rather than regulated by food availability.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated pigeon guillemots (Cepphus columba) as monitors of
   nearshore fish abundance and community composition during 1995-1999 at
   Kachemak Bay, Alaska. We studied the composition of chick diets at 10
   colonies and simultaneously measured fish abundance around colonies with
   beach seines and bottom trawls. Sandeels (Ammodytes hexapterus) formed
   the majority of the diet at one group of colonies. Temporal variability
   in sandeel abundance explained 74\% of inter-annual variability in diet
   composition at these colonies and 93\% of seasonal variability. Diets at
   other colonies were dominated by demersal fish. Among these colonies,
   81\% of the variability in the proportion of sandeels in diets was
   explained by spatial differences in sandeel abundance. Pigeon guillemots
   exhibited a non-linear functional response to sandeel abundance in the
   area where these fish were most abundant. Temporal and spatial
   variability in demersal fish abundance was not consistently reflected in
   diets. Spatial differences in the proportion of different demersal
   fishes in the diet may have been driven by differences in guillemot prey
   preference. Prey specialization by individual pigeon guillemots was
   common, and may operate at the colony level. Inter-annual variability in
   sandeel abundance may have been tracked more accurately because the
   magnitude of change (Il-fold) was greater than that of demersal fish
   (three-fold). (C) 2000 International Council for the Exploration of the

Abstract = {{1. The rodent Psammomys obesus is the main reservoir host for Leishmania
   major, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Tunisia, much
   of North Africa and mid-western Asia. An understanding of the population
   dynamics of this rodent is essential to establish a preventive control
   strategy based on the early prediction of rodent outbreaks.
   2. The study of P. obesus dynamics at a regional scale requires
   index-based sampling. Rodent numbers were monitored twice per year at
   the beginning and end of the breeding season, using transects around the
   Sidi Bouzid region in central Tunisia.
   3. Two different types of dynamics occurred in two drainage basins.
   Rodents living in the northern basin were at low density and those
   living in the southern basin were at high density.
   4. At the scale of a plot, occupied burrows were generally associated
   with the presence of three Chenopodiaceae: Arthrocnemum glaucum, Salsola
   tetrandra and Su ae da fruticosa, rarely in monospecific formations.
   However, in dry periods, occupied burrows drifted to A. glaucum
   formation linked with high moisture and salinity of the soil (chi(2)
   MacNemar = 6.26).
   5. The risk of a P. obesus outbreak can be assessed by a simultaneous
   knowledge of flooding regimes in the drainage basins, the distribution
   of halophytic plant formations, and the progressive movements of the
   rodents as drying out proceeds. The transect indices of rodents are
   easily repeatable, economical and would be applicable in other
   developing countries where cutaneous leishmaniasis occurs.
   6. This work illustrates that simple ecological methods can assist the
   assessment of spatial and temporal components of epidemiological risk
   such as the proximity between rodent colonies and human habitats at the
   time of outbreaks.}},

Abstract = {{Marine aquaculture in The Netherlands consists of extensive culture of
   mussels (Mytilus edulis) and oysters (Crassostrea gigas and Ostrea

   These grounds are located in the Wadden Sea and in the Dutch delta area.
   Quality of shellfish growing areas, and the handling and processing are
   carried out according to EU standards and controlled by the Dutch
   authorities. Stock assessment prior to the mussel spat collection in
   spring and autumn from wild stocks is carried out to estimate the
   availability of mussels for relaying but also in relation to feed
   requirements for protected bird populations. In years of scarcity,
   intertidal areas are closed to harvesting in addition to other,
   permanently closed areas. Oyster spat collection is carried out by
   seeding out mussel shells as spat collectors prior to spatfall. The
   management of shellfish stocks is regulated on the basis of overall
   fishery policy, laid down in a policy document since 1993, and carried
   out jointly by governmental institutions and producers' organizations.}},

Abstract = {{This study was undertaken to identify sex pheromone components of nettle
   caterpillars Darna trima and Darna bradleyi (Lepidoptera: Limacodidae)
   whose larvae defoliate oil palm, Elaeis guineensis, in southeast Asia.
   Coupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD)
   analyses of pheromone gland extracts revealed two antennally active
   compounds produced by female D. trima and two by female D. bradleyi.
   Molecular structures of these candidate pheromone components were
   identified by electron-impact and chemical-ionization mass spectrometry;
   retention-index calculations on DB-5, DB-23, and DB-210 columns;
   microanalytical treatments, as well as syntheses of ``auxilliary{''}
   compounds that facilitated identification of the compounds. The
   compounds from D. trima were 2-methylbutyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (A) and
   (E)-2-hexenyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (B); from D. bradleyi we identified
   methyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (C), and isobutyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate (D).
   In field experiments in Malaysia, (S)-2-methylbutyl (E)-7,9-decadienoate
   (SA) in combination with B proved to be essential and synergistic
   pheromone components for attraction of male D. trima. (R)-2-Methylbutyl
   (E)-7,9-decadienoate (RA) had no behavioral activity. Compound D singly
   attracted male D. bradleyi, but addition of C to D at a 1:10 ratio
   significantly enhanced attractiveness of the bait. Synthetic pheromone
   blends were more effective trap baits than unmated female moths and
   could be developed for monitoring populations of D. trima and D.
   bradleyi in Asian oil palm plantations.}},

Abstract = {{We present a field-based approach to detect and monitor insects with
   resistance to insecticidal toxins produced ty transgenic plants. Out
   objective is to estimate the phenotypic frequency of resistance in a
   population by relating the densities of insects on genetically
   transformed plants to densities on nontransformed plants. We focus on
   European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hubner), in sweet corn, Zea
   mays L., expressing Cry1Ab from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki
   Berliner to illustrate principles underlying the method. Thr probability
   of detecting one or more rare, resistant larvae depends on sample size,
   the density of larvae on nontransformed plants. and an assumed frequency
   of resistant phenotypes in a given population. Probability of detection
   increases with increases in sample size, background density, or the
   frequency of resistant individuals. Following binomial probability
   theory, if a frequency of 10(-4) is expected. 10(3)-10(4) samples must
   Le collected from a B. thuringiensis (Bt) crop to have at least a 95\%
   probability of locating one or more resistant larvae. In-field screens
   using transgenic crops have several advantages over traditional
   laboratory-based methods, including exposure to a large number of feral
   insects, discrimination of resistant individuals based on Bt dosages
   expressed in the field, incorporation of natural and Bt-induced
   mortality factors, simultaneous monitoring for more than one insect
   species, and ease of use. The approach is amenable to field survey crews
   working in research, extension, and within the seed corn industry.
   Estimates of the phenotypic frequency of resistance front the in-field
   screen can Le useful for estimating Initial frequency of resistant
   alleles. Bayesian statistical methods are outlined to estimate phenotype
   frequencies, allele frequencies, and associated confidence intervals
   from field data. Results of the approach are discussed relative to
   existing complementary methods currently available for O. nubilalis and
   corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie).}},

Abstract = {{Mobility and distribution of adult tarnished plant Lug, Lygus lineolaris
   (Palisot de Beauvois), was studied on a day-neutral strawberry cultivar
   ('Selva') in 1991 and 1992 at L'Acadie, Quebec, Canada. On cage-covered
   plants, individuals were located mainly on reproductive parts Study of
   the flight activity with sticky posts revealed that most captures were
   obtained <1 m from ground level and that the time of the day at which
   the maximum counts occur varied among seasons. Three pest-sampling
   methods (white sticky trap, tapping of flower clusters, and D-Vac) were
   evaluated over continuous 24-h periods, Maximum captures of adults with
   white sticky traps were made at midday (1000-1400 hours), whereas the
   two other methods proved more effective at the beginning (0600-0800
   hours) or the end of the day (2000-2200 hours) or during night time. For
   nymphs, maximum catches were obtained during the day with tapping and
   D-Vac; white stick, traps were ineffective. Because the D-Vac captures
   individuals present on all parts of the plant, these counts were used to
   monitor the effectiveness of the two other sampling techniques. The data
   suggest that tapping newer clusters throughout the day is a very
   effective sampling method to estimate nymphal tarnished plant bug
   populations in strawberries. However, sampling of populations with a
   high proportion of adults should take into account the bias caused by
   their flight activity, and sampling should be conducted early in the
   morning or at the end of the day.}},

   curculionids Diaprepes abbreviatus (L.) and Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.)
   weighing 50-300 mg were detected easily in the laboratory and in the
   field except under extremely windy or noisy conditions. Cephus cinctus

   variable among individuals and species, although D. abbreviatus grubs
   tended to be more active than those of O. sulcatus. Tests were done to
   compare acoustically predicted infestations with the contents of soil
   samples taken at recording sites. Under laboratory or ideal field
   conditions, active insects within approximate to 30 cm were identified
   with nearly 100\% reliability. In field tests under adverse conditions,
   the reliability decreased to approximate to 75\%. These results indicate
   that acoustic systems with vibration sensors have considerable potential

   nondestructive scouting and mapping of soil insect populations.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory bioassays were used to develop a diagnostic assay test for
   identifying greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), populations that
   are insecticide-resistant. Petri dish assays with chlorpyrifos showed
   greenbug mortality should be monitored after 2 h of exposure. One-hour
   exposure did not kill a high percentage of susceptible greenbugs, and a
   3-h exposure killed too many resistant greenbugs. Ethanol and methanol
   were both good solvents for mixing with chlorpyrifos in the petri dish
   assay. From the laboratory bioassays, four diagnostic concentrations of
   chlorpyrifos (3, 10, 30, and 100 ppm) were evaluated in the field by
   Texas A\&M University agricultural research and extension entomologists
   across the Texas High Plains. Results from the diagnostic assay tests
   were compared with gel-electrophoresis resistance tests to validate
   resistance detection. The diagnostic assay tests game the same greenbug
   resistance identification as the gel-electrophoresis analysis in 21 of
   22 field bioassays in 1994, and 35 of 39 field bioassays in 1995.
   Diagnostic concentrations of 30 and 100 ppm chlorpyrifos killed greater
   than or equal to 85 and greater than or equal to 90\%, respectively, of
   greenbugs identified by gel-electrophoresis as susceptible and < 40\%
   and <55\%, respectively, of resistant greenbugs. The diagnostic assay
   technique is a quick, reliable, and inexpensive method for detecting
   insecticide resistance in greenbug populations.}},

Abstract = {{Durable resistance to greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), in wheat
   is a goal of wheat improvement teams, and one that has been complicated
   by the regular occurrence of damaging biotypes. Simulation modeling
   studies suggest that pyramiding resistance genes, i.e., combining more
   than one resistance gene in a single cultivar or hybrid, may provide
   more durable resistance than sequential releases of single genes. We
   examined this theory by pyramiding resistance genes in wheat and testing
   a series of greenbug biotypes. Resistance genes Gb2, Gb3, and Gb6, and
   pyramided genes Gb2/Gb3, Gb2/Gb6, and Gb3/Gb6 were tested for
   effectiveness against biotypes E, F, G, H, and I. By comparing reactions
   of plants with pyramided genes to those with single resistance genes, we
   found that pyramiding provided no additional protection over that
   conferred Ly the single resistance genes. Based on the results of this
   test, we concluded that the sequential release of single resistance
   genes, combined with careful monitoring of greenbug population biotypes,
   is the most effective gene deployment strategy for greenbug resistance
   in wheat.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-three Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), populations
   collected in the southeastern (Alabama and Mississippi), midwestern
   (Indiana), and northwestern (Idaho and Washington) United States from
   1995 to 1999 were evaluated for biotype composition based on response to
   Hessian fly resistance genes H3,H5, H6, and H7H8 in wheat, Triticum
   aestivum L. Biotypes L and O, combined, mode up at least 60\% of all
   Alabama populations. Biotype L was predominant in the northern third of
   Alabama and biotype O in the southern two-thirds of the state. Based on
   biotype data, wheat cultivars with H7H8 resistance should he highly
   effective in central and southern Alabama. Fifty-four percent of the
   Mississippi population consisted of biotype L, and the remaining
   virulent biotypes (B, D, E, G, J, and O) ranged in frequency from 1 to
   17\%. The Mississippi population also contained 4\% of the avirulent
   biotype GP. Only biotypes D and L were found in Indiana populations, but
   biotype L was predominant. Hessian fly populations from Idaho and
   Washington contained one or more of the virulent biotypes D-H, J, and
   L-O; however, only biotypes E, F, and G occurred at frequencies >12\%.
   The avirulent biotype GP made up 25-57\% of Idaho and Washington
   populations, a much higher percentage than found in populations from the
   eastern United States. Although the highest level of virulence in Idaho
   and Washington populations was found to resistance genes H3 and H6, the
   frequency of biotype GP would indicate that the currently deployed gene
   H3 would provide a moderate to high level of resistance, depending on
   location. Nine of the populations, plus populations collected from the
   mid-Atlantic state area in 1989 and 1996, also were tested against the
   wheat cultivar `INW9811' that carries H13 resistance to Hessian ny
   biotype L and two Purdue wheat lines with unidentified genes for
   resistance. The H13 resistance in INW9811 was highly effective against
   all populations tested from the eastern and northwestern U.S. wheat
   production areas, except Maryland and Virginia. population studies also
   indicated that wheat line CI 17960-1-1-2-4-2-10 likely carries the H13
   resistance gene, based on the similarity of its response and that of
   INW9811 to eight flp populations. Continued monitoring of biotype
   frequency in Hessian ny populations is required for optimal deployment
   and management of resistance genes in all wheat production areas.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian social organization can vary over ecological time. We
   experimentally manipulated food resources in enclosed populations of
   prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) to test the hypothesis that food
   quality influences the potential for group formation. During each field
   season, populations were started by releasing 5 pairs of prairie voles
   into each of 8 0.1-ha enclosures. Populations were monitored for 18-19
   weeks during each field season. One-half of the enclosures received
   supplemental food, and the other one-half were unsupplemented controls.
   Density of voles increased throughout each field season. There were
   significant increases through time in philopatry and number of groups in
   both the food-supplemented and unsupplemented treatments, but there were
   no differences between treatments. Groups formed early in the season,
   apparently before the need for thermoregulatory benefits. Results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that the social organization of prairie
   voles is not flexible in response to changes in food quality but that
   formation of groups might be a density-dependent response.}},

Abstract = {{Daily data for fine (<2.5 mu m) and coarse (2.5-10 mu m) particles are
   available for 1995-1997 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
   (EPA) research monitor in Phoenix, AZ. Mortality effects on the 65 and
   over population were studied for both the city of Phoenix and for a
   region of about 50 mi around Phoenix. Coarse particles in Phoenix are
   believed to be natural in origin and spatially homogeneous, whereas fine
   particles are primarily vehicular in origin and concentrated in the city
   itself. For this reason, it is natural to focus on city mortality data
   when considering fine particles, and on region mortality data when
   considering coarse particles, and most of the results reported here
   correspond to those assignments.
   After allowing for seasonality and long-term trend through a nonlinear
   (B-spline) trend curve, and also for meteorological effects based on
   temperature and specific humidity, a regression of mortality was
   performed on PM using several different measures for PM. Based on a
   linear PM effect, we found a statistically significant coefficient for
   coarse particles, but not for fine particles, contrary to what is widely
   believed about the effects of coarse and fine particles. An analysis of
   nonlinear pollution-mortality relationships, however, suggests that the
   true picture is more complicated than that. For coarse particles, the
   evidence for any nonlinear or threshold-based effect is slight. For fine
   particles, we found evidence of a threshold, most likely with values in
   the range of 20-25 mu g/m(3). We also found some evidence of
   interactions of the PM effects with season and year.
   The main effect here is an apparent seasonal interaction in the coarse
   PM effect. An attempt was made to explain this in terms of seasonal
   variation in the chemical composition of PM, but this led to another
   counterintuitive result: the PM effect is highest in spring and summer,
   when the anthropogenic concentration of coarse PM is lowest as
   determined by a principal components analysis. There was no evidence of
   confounding between the fine and coarse PM effects. Although these
   results are based on one city and should be considered tentative until
   replicated in other studies, they suggest that the prevailing focus on
   fine rather than coarse particles may be an oversimplification. The
   study also shows that consideration of nonlinear effects can lead to
   real changes of interpretation and raises the possibility of seasonal
   effects associated with the chemical composition of PM.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new statistical model designed to extend our
   understanding from prior personal exposure field measurements of urban
   populations to other cities where ambient monitoring data, but no
   personal expo sure measurements, exist. The model partitions personal
   exposure into two distinct components: ambient concentration and
   nonambient concentration. It is assumed the ambient and nonambient
   concentration components are uncorrelated and add together; therefore,
   the model is called a random component superposition (RCS) model. The
   24-hr ambient outdoor concentration is multiplied by a dimensionless
   ``attenuation factor{''} between 0 and 1 to account for deposition of
   particles as the ambient air infiltrates indoors. The RCS model is
   applied to field PM10 measurement. data from three large-scale personal
   exposure field studies: THEES (Total Human Environmental Exposure Study)
   in Phillipsburg, NJ; PTEAM (Particle Total Exposure Assessment
   Methodology) in Riverside, CA; and the Ethyl Corporation study in
   Toronto, Canada. Because indoor sources and activities (smoking,
   cooking, cleaning, the personal cloud, etc.) may be similar in similar
   populations, it was hypothesized that the statistical distribution of
   nonambient personal exposure is invariant across cities.
   Using a fixed 24-hr attenuation factor as a first approximation derived
   from regression analysis for the respondents, the distributions of
   nonambient PM10 personal exposures were obtained for each city. Although
   the mean ambient PM10 concentrations in the three cities varied from
   27.9 mu g/m(3) in Toronto to 60.9 mu g/m(3) in Philligsburg to 94.1 mu
   g/m(3) in Riverside, the mean nonambient components of personal
   exposures were found to be closer: 52.6 mu g/m(3) in Toronto; 52.4 mu
   g/m(3) in Phillipsbug; and 59.2 mu g/m(3) in Riverside. The three
   frequency distributions of the nonambient components of exposure also
   were similar in shape, giving support to the hypothesis that nonambient
   concentrations are similar across different cities and populations.
   These results indicate that, if the ambient concentrations were
   completely controlled and set to zero in all three cities, the median of
   the remaining personal exposures to PM10 would range from 32.0 mu g/m(3)
   (Toronto) to 34.4 mu g/m(3) (Phillipsburg) to 48.8 mu g/m(3)
   (Riverside). The highest-exposed 30\% of the population in the three
   cities would still be exposed to 24-hr average PM10 concentrations of
   47-74 mu g/m(3); the highest 20\% would be exposed to concentrations of
   56-92 mu g/m(3); the highest 10\% to concentrations of 88-131 mu g/m(3);
   and the highest: 5\% to 133-175 mu g/m(3), due only to indoor sources
   and activities. The distribution for the difference between personal
   exposures and indoor concentrations, or the ``personal cloud,{''} also
   was similar in the three cities, with a mean of 30-35 mu g/m(3),
   suggesting that the personal cloud accounts for more than half of the
   nonambient component of PM10 personal exposure in the three cities.
   Using only the ambient measurements in Toronto, the nonambient data from
   THEES in Phillipsburg was used to predict the entire personal exposure
   distribution in Toronto. The PM10 exposure distribution predicted by the
   model showed reasonable agreement with the PM10 personal exposure
   distribution measured in Toronto. These initial results suggest that the
   RCS model may be a powerful tool for predicting personal exposure
   distributions and statistics in other cities where only ambient particle
   data are available.}},

Abstract = {{Time-series of daily mortality data from May 1992 to September 1995 for
   various portions of the seven-county Philadelphia, PA, metropolitan area
   were analyzed in relation to weather and a variety of ambient air
   quality parameters. The air quality data included measurements of
   size-classified PM, SO42-, and H+ that had been collected by the Harvard
   School of Public Health, as well as routine air pollution monitoring
   data. Because the various pollutants df interest were measured at
   different locations within the metropolitan area, it was necessary to
   test for spatial sensitivity by comparing results for different
   combinations of locations,Estimates are presented for single pollutants
   and for multiple-pollutant models, including gaseous pollutants and
   mutually exclusive components of PM (PM2.5 and coarse particles, SO42-
   and non-SO42- portions of total suspended particulate {[}TSP] and PM10),
   measured on the day of death and the previous day.
   We concluded that associations between air quality and mortality were
   not limited to data collected in the same part of the metropolitan area;
   that is, mortality for one part may be associated with air quality data
   from another, not necessarily neighboring, part. Significant
   associations were found for a wide variety of gaseous and particulate
   pollutants, especially for peak O-3. Using joint regressions on peak O-3
   with various other pollutants, we found that the combined responses were
   insensitive to the specific other pollutant selected. We saw no
   systematic differences according to particle size or chemistry. In
   general, the associations between daily mortality and air pollution
   depended on the pollutant or the PM metric, the type of collection
   filter used, and the location of sampling. Although peak O-3 seemed to
   exhibit the most consistent mortality responses, this finding should be
   confirmed by analyzing separate seasons and other time periods.}},

   length of two populations (Oregon, Washington) of D. subobscura, which
   was introduced in the Pacific Northwest in the late 1970s. Wing length
   varied seasonally and was shortest in summer. In Washington, however,
   wing length was longest in spring, not winter. Wing length was inversely
   and curvilinearly related to mean ambient temperature, as in a few
   previous studies of drosophilids. Mid-winter D. subobscura might not be
   the largest either because extremely low temperatures depress size or
   because flies collected in winter were in fact born the previous autumn,
   when developmental temperatures were more moderate. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Siren (1955) studied understorey species composition, tree stand
   properties and humus-layer thickness in 64 unlogged forest stands on
   topographically and pedologically comparable sites. The stands were of
   even age (6 - 300 yr), stocked with the first or second tree generation
   after wildfire. The view of Siren and several authors after him, that
   the vegetation of old-growth boreal Picea forests is homogeneous on a
   broad scale. was examined by applying, in parallel, the partial variants
   of two ordination methods (DCA and PCA) to Siren's vegetation data. Two
   main vegetation gradients were found: a major gradient running from
   recently burnt plots with prominence of pioneer species to plots with
   stand age > 100 yr, a well stocked tree layer and a thick humus layer,
   dominance of feather-mosses and ample occurrence of shade-tolerant as
   well as light-preferring vascular plant species, and a second gradient
   along which first- and second-generation plots segregate. The more
   prominent element of Betula trees in first- than in second-generation
   stands < 100 yr contributed to the latter. A minor third gradient
   related to humus-layer thickness was recovered by partial DCA only. The
   main vegetation gradient reappeared in separate ordinations of data from
   47 mature forest stands (> 100 yr), but without being correlated with
   forest age. Variation among mature-forest stands in the importance of
   pioneer species is considered mainly to be brought about by fine-scale
   disturbance processes such as tree uprooting. Increasing importance of
   factors operating on within-stand scales {[}development of a varied gap
   structure and stronger gradients in tree influence (radiation at ground
   level), soil moisture, soil depth and nutrient availability] with time
   is also reflected in the second and third mature-forest ordination axes.
   Possible implications of the results for conservation of biological
   diversity and monitoring of changes in boreal forests are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and reproduction were compared among six geographically and
   genetically distinct intertidal populations of the annual, semelparous,
   dorid nudibranch Adalaria proxima (Alder \& Hancock) to evaluate
   Variation in fitness-related traits. The six populations spanned the
   geographic range in the northern British Isles: NE England (Cowling
   Scar), E Scotland (Kinkell Braes), NW Scotland (Loch Eriboll), W
   Scotland (Cuan Ferry), Northern Ireland (Portaferry), and N Wales (Menai
   Bridge). Nudibranchs from five sites were collected in July to August
   1992 as post-metamorphic juveniles and were laboratory-reared under the
   same conditions of ambient temperature and photoperiod for up to 10
   months and the completion of spawning. Individuals from the sixth site
   were added to the experiment in December 1992. Growth was monitored
   every 2 weeks, and reproductive performance was expressed as a
   weight-adjusted dimensionless index (Sigma RI) of each individual's
   spawnings summed over the reproductive period. In general, larger
   nudibranchs produced larger first spawn masses and more total spawn than
   did smaller nudibranchs, but these size-related trends were observed
   only in some populations. The patterns of energy partitioning to
   spawnings varied significantly among populations, from allocations of a
   large number of eggs to few spawn masses (Loch Eriboll) to production of
   many small spawnings over a long spawning period (Portaferry). There was
   no relationship between maximum body size and the amount of spawn
   produced after the first spawning, nor to the length of the spawning
   period or the number of spawn produced. Both Menai Bridge and Kinkell
   Braes had low mean population Sigma RI reflecting a very poor
   reproductive performance, given their large maximum (pre-spawning) body
   sizes. By contrast, the Loch Eriboll, Cuan Ferry, and Portaferry
   populations all displayed high mean population Sigma RI. albeit as a
   result of differing combinations of numbers and sizes of spawn masses
   and duration of the spawning period. This high variance of reproductive
   allocation among populations, and previous evidence of relatively stable
   among-population differences in allozyme frequencies, adult color, and
   embryo characteristics suggest very restricted larval transport of
   lecithotrophic larvae of A. proxima.}},

Abstract = {{Metrosideros bartlettii (Myrtaceae) is a distinctive and extremely rare
   tree, endemic to New Zealand, first discovered in 1975. Prior to this
   study, a total of 19 adult individuals of the species had been reported;
   these are located in three small forest remnants in the far north of the
   North Island of New Zealand. Here we describe a total of 31 adult M.
   bartlettii at the three sites, including 12 individuals newly discovered
   by us. We analyse the genetic diversity of the species, using
   microsatellites to examine the chloroplast genome and amplified fragment
   length polymorphisms (AFLPs) to monitor nuclear variation. The results
   clearly demonstrate that hi. bartlettii is a unique species, distinct
   from its two closest relatives M. robusta and M. excelsa. Analysis of
   genetic diversity within the 31 remaining individuals of M, bartlettii
   showed an average heterozygosity (< H >) of 0.18 and a proportion of
   polymorphic genes (< P >) of 0.44. Population structure, as shown by 286
   AFLP loci, varied between the three geographical sites; the site with
   fewest individuals, containing two trees, showed some separation from
   the populations at the other two locations. These two latter sites, by
   contrast, had highly overlapping AFLP population diversity profiles. The
   implications of these results for conservation of the species are
   discussed.}},

   philopatric juvenile snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) in southwestern
   Yukon Territory, Canada, during a cyclic population increase. Neither
   28-d survival nor the proportion of hares surviving to breed differed
   significantly between juvenile hares that dispersed and those that did
   not, nor was there a significant relationship between dispersal distance
   and fate (dead or alive). Our results indicate that the overall survival
   cost associated with natal dispersal is low for snowshoe hares during

Abstract = {{During the last decades, king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus)
   populations have been reported to increase throughout most of their
   breeding range. In this study, we compared the results obtained from
   direct counts of incubating king penguins with the results yielded by
   the estimation of the change in area occupied by breeding birds at the
   Ratmanoff king penguin colony at the Kerguelen Islands. The area of the
   colony was determined using a Geographical Information System with a
   georeferencing extension on aerial pictures taken in 1963, 1985 and
   1998. Individual king penguin were counted on the same pictures or
   pictures taken on the same day. The overall population increase between
   1963 and 1998 was 733\% while the colony area increased by 677\%. This
   study indicates that monitoring change in colony size is a good
   indicator for detecting and monitoring large population changes in king
   penguins, in particular for remote colonies. The discrepancy between the
   two results may be from two different kinds of bias. Firstly, there
   could be a possible error in the estimation of the area occupied by the
   colony resulting from the georeferencing of oblique pictures, and
   secondly, the density of king penguins may also change with population
   number. This method, which only requires high-altitude pictures, also
   reduces the possible disturbance to breeding made by low- to
   medium-altitude flights.}},

Abstract = {{Tape recordings of two types of vocalisations were used to assess bun-ow
   occupancy by white-chinned petrels (Procellaria aequinoetialis) at South
   Georgia. Birds responded to the rattle call on 74\% of occasions and a
   wheezy call on 85\%, with only 10\% railing to respond to both calls
   played one after the other. Occupancy was determined throughout the
   pre-egg and incubation period and results confirmed what is known about
   patterns of occupancy by white-chinned petrels. Adults in burrows known
   to hatch a chick responded on average to 69\% of recordings during
   incubation and less than 10\% in only 4\% of burrows. Significant
   inter-site and inter-annual variations in occupancy were recorded,
   suggesting that this method is sensitive to changes in the number of
   petrels returning to breed. A sampling protocol for providing population
   indices for monitoring purposes is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Kitahara and Fujii, in 1994, analyzed the butterfly communities along a
   gradient of human disturbance by applying the generalist/specialist
   concept. Butterfly species were classified into generalist or specialist
   species based on their voltinism (seasonal time dimension) and potential
   larval resource breadth (food dimension). The community structure and
   species composition showed the systematic changes along the gradient. To
   verify the generality of those trends, we monitored five grassland
   butterfly communities with varying degrees of human disturbance twice a
   month during 1985 by the line transect method at the foot of Mt. Fuji,
   central Japan, and analyzed their structure in a manner similar to that
   employed by Kitahara and Fujii. Most results were consistent with the
   patterns recognized by Kitahara and Fujii. The route (community) order
   based on increasing human disturbance was strongly and negatively
   correlated with butterfly species richness but with neither butterfly
   species diversity (H') nor evenness (J'). Also, the degree of human
   disturbance was significantly and negatively correlated with the number
   of specialist species, but not with that of generalists, in a community.
   Butterfly species richness was more strongly correlated with the number
   of specialist species than with that of generalists. Our analyses also
   showed that the generalist species were distributed more widely over the
   communities than were the specialists. However, in contrast to the trend
   revealed by Kitahara and Fujii, there was no significant difference in
   the population densities and in the spatial population variability
   between the two species groups. As a whole, our analyses confirmed the
   consistency of most community patterns detected by Kitahara and Fujii.
   The causes of the inconsistencies in some patterns were thought to be
   mainly the present habitat conditions with a relatively short growing
   season at high altitudes.}},

Title = {{Uncoupling of metabolism to reduce biomass production in the activated

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},

Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{3204-3212}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Production of excess biomass during biological treatment of wastewaters
   requires costly disposal. Also with environmental and legislative
   constraints limiting disposal options, considerable impetus exists for
   reducing the amount of biomass produced. Uncoupling metabolism in
   activated sludge may reduce biomass production and this approach is
   investigated in conjunction with consequences upon substrate removal and
   population dynamics. To induce uncoupled metabolism, para-nitrophenol
   (pNP) a known protonphoric uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation, was
   introduced to a bench-scale activated sludge process. Microbial
   populations were monitored by both microscopic and by three methods of
   molecular analyses. Presence of the protonphore caused a shift in the
   microbial population with protozoa being washed out of the system and
   filamentous bacteria proliferating. The molecular composition of the
   microbial community was determined by PCR amplification of 16SrRNA genes
   and subsequent denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Band
   Patterns obtained by both a direct and nested approach were similar.
   However, profiles derived from nested PCR contained more bands,
   indicative of the increased sensitivity of this approach. Analysis of
   the active biomass by Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) of small
   molecular weight RNA (5mwRNA) showed that a sustained shift in the
   diversity of the predominant, metabolically active species present
   occurred within two days of the introduction of the protonphore. Biomass
   production was reduced by 49\%, but the total substrate removal rate was
   also reduced by 25\%. The combined effect was a 30\% decrease in the
   biomass yield. Introduction of the protonphore caused substrate removal
   efficiency to decrease from a consistent value of 96\% to 68.5\% with
   considerable variance. This decline in overall process performance was
   attributed to a surmountable effect arising from the design of apparatus
   that resulted in a decrease in the reactor biomass concentration.
   Although the specific biomass volume was consistent throughout,
   decreased sedimentation resulted in solids being removed in the final
   effluent which decreased the amount of biomass which could be recycled.
   The catalytic efficiency of the biomass increased as reflected by a 3.3
   fold increase in the specific substrate uptake rate. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The slow growth of Renibacterium salmoninarum limits the usefulness of
   culture as a research tool. Development of a 2-color flow cytometric
   assay to quantify the proportions of live and dead R. salmoninarum in a
   test population is described. Bacteria were simultaneously stained with
   fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated immunoglobulin and exposed to the
   exclusion dye propidium iodide. Propidium iodide red fluorescence
   profiles of control groups of untreated and killed R. salmoninarum were
   compared with those for bacteria exposed to chlorine. Bacterial
   inactivation was based on mean red fluorescence intensity, and analyzed
   by high-red fluorescence intensity (HRFI) and curve subtraction (CS)
   analyses. When the concentration of R. salmoninarum was 8.65 x 10(6)
   bacteria ml(-1) and the bacteria exposed to chlorine at 1 mg l(-1) for
   periods from 1 to 20 min (high-Rs assessment), the mean red fluorescence
   intensity of the profile for each chlorine-exposure group was higher
   than that for the untreated control (p < 0.0001). When the concentration
   of R. salmoninarum was reduced to 1.76 x 10(6) bacteria ml(-1) and
   exposed to 0.8 mg l(-1) free chlorine level for periods from 20 s to 5
   min (reduced-Rs assessment), the mean red fluorescence intensities of
   the exposure groups were higher than that for the untreated control only
   when the R. salmoninarum was exposed to chlorine for at least 1 min (p
   less than or equal to 0.01). On the basis of red fluorescence intensity,
   the proportion of dead cells generally increased with the duration of
   chlorine exposure. Whereas the rates of inactivation derived from the
   HRFI and CS analyses did not correlate with the duration of exposure in
   the high-Rs assessment (r(2) less than or equal to 0.27), there was a
   correlation between these estimates and the duration of exposure in the
   reduced-Rs assessment (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.92). Because of
   the rapid loss of culturable R. salmoninarum in both assessments
   following chlorine exposure, neither the duration of exposure nor the
   inactivation estimates correlated with bacteriological culture (r(2)
   less than or equal to 0.22). In both assessments, there was a
   correlation between the estimates of inactivation based upon HRFI and CS
   analyses (r(2) > 0.99). These results suggest that flow cytometry can be
   used as a supplementary or alternative method to bacteriological culture
   for monitoring the inactivation of R. salmoninarum.}},

Abstract = {{The activation of carp peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) was analysed
   radiometrically and by means of flow cytometry (FCM) in order to compare
   the results obtained with both methods. The qualitative and quantitative
   FCM analyses of cellular morphology and viability resulted in a further
   characterisation of proliferative responses of carp PBL to Trypanoplasma
   borreli in vivo and in vitro. The lymphocyte population of PBL from T.
   borreli-infected carp exhibited a marked shift in forward scattered
   light (FSC; cell size). When PBL from healthy carp were stimulated with
   mitogens in vitro, a lymphoid population with increased FSC profiles was
   also observed. The number of these cells coincided to ratios of
   H-3-thymidine incorporation, recorded from corresponding cultures. Thus,
   it was concluded that the increase in size of stimulated lymphocytes
   could be due to blastogenic transformation. The advantage of the FCM
   procedure is that activation and proliferation of carp lymphocytes can
   be monitored without labelling the cells. Cocultures of
   mitogen-stimulated carp PBL and T. borreli revealed the ability of the
   parasite to suppress lymphocyte proliferation in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{Negative effects on native plant populations are often attributed to
   invasions by exotic plants, but experimental evidence is lacking to
   support many of these claims. Lonicera maackii, an exotic shrub with
   long leaf phenology, has become naturalized throughout the eastern
   United States. This study investigated the effects of L. maachii on
   demography of Galium aparine, Impatiens pallida and Pilea pumila, native
   annual herbs in differing phenological categories. These interactions
   were examined in two Ohio forest stands. One stand has a history of
   logging. burning and grazing and a higher L. maackii density whereas the
   other stand has little anthropogenic disturbance and a lower L. maackii
   density. Three types of experimental plots were established: L. maackii
   removal, L. maackii present and, at the less disturbed stand, L. maackii
   absent. Seedlings of the annuals were transplanted and monitored for 1 y
   for survival to reproductive age and fecundity.
   In the more disturbed stand, survival of Galium aparine and Impatiens
   pallida and fecundity of all three species were significantly greater in
   the removal treatment than where Lonicera maackii was present. In the
   less disturbed stand there was no treatment effect on survival, but
   fecundity of all annuals was greater in the removal treatment than where
   L. maackii was present. Also, fecundity of I. pallida and Piles pumila
   was greater where L. maackii was absent than where it was present. At
   both sites fitness (estimated as the product of survival and fecundity)
   was highest for each species in the removal treatment and lowest where
   L. maackii was present.
   These results demonstrate direct effects of the invasive shrub Lonicera
   maackii on populations of annuals. They suggest that other annuals,
   particularly those that are shade-intolerant or photosynthesize only in
   the early spring, will decline in the presence of shrubs with early leaf
   expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Mead's milkweed, Asclepias meadii, is a rare long-lived perennial of
   North American tallgrass prairies. Stems of this clonal species are
   spatially aggregated and, therefore, observing survivorship and
   flowering of ``patches{''} of stems best approximates the fate of
   genetic individuals. Population size is likely to be underestimated
   because more than one genotype can sometimes occur in a patch. The
   number of patches detected at a site in Kansas has greatly increased
   over the last 11 y since marking locations of individual patches allowed
   detection of nonflowering stems in subsequent years. The A. meadii
   population at our site (managed by biennial dormant-season burning)
   often had more flowering ramets and produced more mature follicles in
   years with burning. High rainfall in the preceding year, in conjunction
   with burning, was associated with the highest follicle production. The
   difficulties in detection of plants at the site mean that counts of
   numbers of patches over an 11-y period cannot be used to assess whether
   the population is increasing, decreasing or remaining constant. Several
   factors indicate a positive outlook for the population: management
   (burning) enhances fruit production, patch survivorship is high and a
   likelihood that more patches exist than are counted. However, the low
   fruit production in most years at the site is a concern for the
   long-term viability of the population.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation status of the eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale
   putorius) was assessed in the Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee from
   November 1995 through June 1997. Population status and seasonal
   abundance were examined using live-trapping on an 8 X 8 grid in Monroe
   County. Relative abundance was assessed at selected sites in Blount,
   Greene, Monroe, Unicoi and Washington counties employing additional
   live-trapping methods. In 5723 trap-nights only four S. putorius were
   captured (trap-success rate = 0.07\%). The most common mammals captured
   were the opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and the raccoon (Procyon lotor).
   All eastern spotted skunks were captured in rhododendron (Rhododendron
   spp.) thickets near streams. A program to monitor the status of the
   species in the Appalachians is recommended as a management measure.}},

Abstract = {{Relocation of nest sites is common among mice of the genus Peromyscus.
   We documented the occupation of artificial nest boxes by litters of
   white-footed mice (P. leucopus) at different stages of development to
   determine if nest relocation by lactating females is related to the
   developmental stage of the offspring. Three stages of development
   (neonates, age 0-5 d; nestlings, age 6-14 d; and juveniles, age 15-27 d)
   were recognized Although the nest boxes were monitored at approximately
   weekly intervals, 72\% of 134 litters were observed during only one of
   the stages of development, indicating that movement of young during
   lactation was common. Comparison of observed use of the boxes at
   different stages of development of young to expected use indicated that
   use of boxes was not random. Boxes were used relatively infrequently by
   dams with neonates and nestlings and most frequently by dams and
   juveniles. We believe that the suitability of a nest site to a lactating
   female depends on the age of her litter and that the size of the nest
   cavity may be an important factor in nest selection.}},

Abstract = {{In managed forests, riparian buffer strips typically are maintained to
   protect water quality. If properly designed, buffer strips also may act
   as wildlife reserves. However, forest managers have lacked the
   information to develop standards for buffer strips to maximize benefits
   for wildlife species. We assessed the conservation potential of 20-,
   100-, and 200-m wide buffers for an area-sensitive songbird in boreal
   mixed-wood forest in Alberta. We measured abundance, territory
   characteristics, and pairing success of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus)
   at treatment and control lakes one year before and after upland timber
   harvest. After harvest, Ovenbirds were absent from 20-m buffer strips.
   Harvesting did not significantly influence abundance or territory size
   in 100-m or 200-m buffers, although territories generally became
   narrower. Postharvest territory position did not change in 200-m
   buffers, but territories in 100-m strips shifted lakeward and included
   more habitat adjacent to the riparian edge than before harvest. Despite
   this shift in territory position, males that occupied 100-m strips
   successfully attracted mates. High availability of regional forest cover
   may have muted the more pronounced effects of habitat alteration
   observed in other studies. Our research is among the first to evaluate
   individual behavioral responses to the creation of forest edges. Our
   data indicate that 20-m buffer strips do not support breeding Ovenbirds,
   whereas 100- and 200-m buffers retain Ovenbirds during the year
   following harvest. Longterm harvest effects may differ from those we
   monitored and require study, particularly as timber extraction increases
   in the boreal mixed-wood ecoregion.}},

Abstract = {{Wolf populations have been relatively stable during the last 15 years in
   seven of nine wildlife reserves located in southern Quebec, despite
   harvest by legal trapping. Wolf densities, estimated via hunter surveys
   and an equation linking questionnaire data and radio-tracking data,
   varied between 0.7 and 2.2 animals/100 km(2). In some reserves, wolf
   populations persisted at ca. 1 individual/100 km(2) with low prey
   densities (i.e. < 2 moose/10 km(2)). Long-term density and trapping data
   indicated that wolf populations frequently sustained annual harvest
   rates exceeding 35\% without experiencing population declines. However,
   such systems appeared unstable, especially for reserves < 1500 km(2) in
   size. Immigration from adjacent areas likely contributed to the
   persistence of wolf populations in reserves that experienced harvest
   rates > 35\%. Although the viability of wolf populations in southern
   Quebec seems not to be threatened by trapping, some wildlife reserves
   act as population sinks, instead of sources, for wolves. The longterm
   conservation of wolves requires reduction of harvests in some reserves,
   and simultaneous monitoring of wolf populations outside wildlife
   reserves. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored breeding eastern meadowlarks, dickcissels, Henslow's
   sparrows, grasshopper sparrows and field sparrows using strip transect
   surveys in 1995 and 1996. The 473-ha study area was an array of 3-ha
   management units of burned, mowed, hayed, grazed and undisturbed (> 1
   year) cool- and warm-season grasses and annual weeds. Management units
   grouped by habitat type (management regime and grass type) had different
   (P < 0.05) abundances of each species. Eastern meadowlarks and
   dickcissels were most frequently observed in grazed warm-season grasses.
   Observation rates of Henslow's sparrows and field sparrows were highest
   in undisturbed warm-season grasses, whereas eastern meadowlarks and
   grasshopper sparrows were observed least often in this habitat type.
   Grasshopper sparrows were observed most frequently in annual weeds;
   Henslow's sparrows and field sparrows were not observed in this habitat
   type. Overall avian abundance was lowest in recently burned cool-season
   grasses. The low-intensity, late-season grazing system was important for
   creating a heterogeneous habitat mosaic attractive to the five species
   studied. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Blue bugloss (Echium acanthocarpum Svent.) is an endangered endemic
   plant of La Gomera (Canary Islands). Little is known about its
   autecology. A seedling cohort was monitored to reveal the causes of
   extreme fluctuations observed in the population. For this purpose we
   analysed two plots, one in which we removed the litter and other plants
   (managed plot), leaving only the seedlings of E. acanthocarpum, and a
   second, control, plot. Seedling mortality in the managed plot was
   correlated with the available area and with the biovolume of individual
   plants, but this was not the case in the control plot. There were
   significantly more seedlings under the canopy of adult plants (influence
   area) than outside this canopy zone. There was also significantly more
   germination near to dead plants than live plants. Some management
   measures for the conservation of E. acanthocarpum are proposed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The Florida Semaphore cactus. Opuntia corallicola, is a rare species
   with a distribution currently limited to one island in the Florida Keys.
   The only 12 mature, flowering individuals known to exist in 1989 were
   threatened by the arrival of an exotic cactus feeding moth, Cactoblastis
   cactorum. Cages were erected in 1990 around these cacti to protect them
   from Cactoblastis. From 1990 to 1998 the O. corallicola population was
   monitored and number of new recruits were measured. In May 1996, we made
   an outplanting of 96 small, new cacti derived from fallen pads, in an
   experimental regime designed to bolster the number of extant cacti and
   to test for the effectiveness of cages as a protection against
   Cactoblastis. Both the natural and the outplanted population declined by
   over 30\% during our monitoring periods. In both the natural population
   and the experimental outplanting most individuals died because of what
   appeared to be stem browning, probably by a plant pathogen. The next
   largest cause of mortality in the outplanting was by trampling, probably
   by Key deer. Cactoblastis destroyed one mature cactus but killed no
   individuals in the outplanting. A hurricane in 1998 was a minor cause of
   death for outplanted individuals but killed two mature cacti. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Sixty-three artificial floating islands (rafts) were sited at
   Black-throated Diver Gavia arctica territories in Scotland, the majority
   during 1992-95. Rafts were mainly 2.4 m x 3.6 m platforms made of
   polystyrene blocks on a wooden frame, covered with growing turf. Rafts
   were sited at lochs (lakes) where breeding success was low and/or nests
   had been flooded. Territory occupancy, nest site and breeding success
   were monitored at territories with and without rafts during 1980-97.
   Rafts were used at least once at 44 territories, representing about
   one-quarter of the national population. Most rafts were used for the
   first time in the first or second year of provision. At territories
   where they where used, rafts improved chick productivity by a factor of
   2.7 (95\% confidence limits: 1.3-6.2). Raft provision probably improved
   the chick production of the Scottish Black-throated Diver population by
   44\% (7-130\%).}},

Abstract = {{The autumn migration of raptors at Falsterbo, Sweden has been studied
   since the early 1940s, and from 1973 standardized counts were made. Here
   we present data for 15 species over a 39-year period from 1942-97. These
   are discussed in the context of available information on population
   trends in Sweden and neighbouring countries. Although annual numbers and
   concentration rate vary considerably between species, population changes
   are very well reflected in the migration figures from Falsterbo. Most
   raptors showed stable populations at a fairly high level during the
   1940s, hilt a marked decline was already obvious in White-tailed Eagle
   Haliaeetus albicilla and Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus. During the
   1950s and 1960s, a more or less steep decline occurred in most species.
   Four species started to increase during the 1960s, but the real change
   came during the 1970s. At that time, decreased human persecution and a
   reduction ill the effects from pesticides resulted ill a general
   increase in Scandinavian raptors, with only Honey Buzzard Pernis
   apivorus continuing to decrease. The increases continued during the
   1980s, but in the 1990s many raptors seem to have reached stable numbers
   or to have started to decline again. Two species, Marsh Harrier Circus
   aeruginosus and Montagu's Harrier C. pygargus show a positive trend
   through the study period. Numbers of Northern Harrier Circus cyaneus,
   Rough-legged Buzzard Buteo lagopus and Eurasian Kestrel Falco
   tinnunculus stabilized during Me 1980s and show a clear decline since
   then, most probably due to a general lack of rodent peaks in Northern
   Scandinavia since 1982. Most species of raptors scent to he doing
   reasonably well at the moment, brit a continuous decline in Honey
   Blizzard and Common Buzzard Buteo buteo is disturbing, and is possibly
   due to declining proportions of old deciduous forest and grazed meadows
   in Scandinavia. Since a general census programme of birds of prey does
   not exist in Sweden, the migration counts at Falsterbo is the best
   general method of monitoring population changes.}},

Abstract = {{Coral communities worldwide are undergoing intense degradation in
   response to natural and human disturbances, and many reef systems have
   already experienced significant declines in live coral cover associated
   with an increase in macroalgal. abundance. Here, we document the
   seasonal dynamics of the macroalgal communities of the Northern Florida
   Reef Tract, providing a baseline for long-term studies of coral-algal
   competition in the area.
   Both macroalgal biomass and percent cover on reefs showed an increasing
   trend from January to July, when both light and temperature conditions
   were favorable for growth. Maximum percent cover (56.7\%) was found in
   July and minimum levels in December (25.8\%). During these peaks in
   algal cover, many corals were completely covered by dense mats of algae.
   Two genera, Halimeda and Dictyota, represented the largest proportion
   (77-99\%) of the total algal biomass. In the summer, Dictyota spp.
   dominated the algal community, occupying up to 40\% of the reef bottom
   with a dry biomass of up to 20 g.m(-2). In addition, two species,
   Stypopodium zonale and Trichogloea requienii, showed a significant bloom
   in April 1998, covering a significant percentage of the bottom (up to
   25\%) at an inshore reef. Species that exhibited rapid space
   monopolization on Florida reefs, such as Dictyota spp. and Stypopodium
   zonale, also showed rapid growth in microcosm and field growth studies.
   No correlations were found between fish grazer abundance and algal
   biomass or percent cover, indicating that present grazer population
   abundance and composition are not adequate to prevent space
   monopolization and coral overgrowth by algae such as Dictyota spp. and
   Halimeda spp. Only a continued monitoring effort will determine whether
   the seasonal dynamics of the algal community may result in the decline
   of coral populations in the Northern Florida Reef Tract.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of the spionid polychaete Boccardia polybranchia were
   monitored for several years in the intertidal sediments of Kerguelen
   Island in the subantarctic province. This shallow water poecilogonous
   species exhibited adelphophagy where the females deposited eggs in
   capsules of which only 3-5\% of the eggs undergo a normal development
   and fed on the remaining eggs. Type I larvae utilized their yolk
   reserves and fed on nurse eggs. After 8 d a second larval type was
   visible in the capsules. These Type II larvae presented a well developed
   and functional gut at the third setiger stage and never ingested any
   nurse eggs in the capsules. The consequences of this developmental
   pattern were important for recruitment. The number of hatching larvae
   was considerably reduced, but the protection in the capsules and the
   position of the capsules within the tubes ensured good local
   recruitment. Larval behavior was also modified with the nearly complete
   lack of a planktonic phase. Dispersal existed for a small number of Type
   II larvae but the general trend led to the formation of dense
   populations of up to 50,000 ind m(-2).}},

Abstract = {{A larval population of spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana
   (Clemens), was monitored for 5 d following aerial application of a
   commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner subsp.
   kurstaki to investigate dose acquisition and expression (larval
   mortality, recovery, feeding, and growth) in relation to spray
   deposition and persistence of spray deposits. The main objective was to
   test if previous laboratory observations on how B. thuringiensis affects
   feeding and dose ingestion by spruce budworm larvae hold true under
   field conditions. About 40\% of the treated population ingested a lethal
   dose within 1 d after spray application. Lethally dosed larvae died
   without further feeding upon transfer from treated foliage to
   (untreated) artificial diet. Resumption of feeding by larvae that
   survived the treatment was delayed relative to larvae from the control
   population during 3 d following spray application: during that time,
   normal feeding activity and larval weight gain were suppressed.
   Inhibited feeding by survivors appeared to prevent further dose uptake
   because the proportion of lethally dosed larvae in daily collections did
   not increase despite significant residual spray deposits in budworm
   feeding sites. Restoration of ``normal{''} recovery times by the fourth
   day coincided with a 65-85\% reduction in persistence of the pathogen on
   the foliage and did not result in further lethal dose acquisition, as
   treatment-induced mortality dropped to about 20\% on the 4th and 5th
   days. The observations are consistent with previous laboratory
   observations of how B. thuringiensis affects larval feeding and with the
   hypothesis that feeding inhibition may be a limiting factor in the
   acquisition of a lethal dose.}},

Abstract = {{We counted migrating King (Somateria spectabilis) and Common (S,
   mollissima v-nigra) elders at Point Barrow, Alaska, during spring and
   summer/fall 1996. During spring (1 May to 2 June), we estimated that 371
   451 (95\% C.I. +/- 109 093) King and 72 606 (95\% C.I. +/- 13 824)
   Common elders passed Point Barrow eastbound. During summer/fall (10 July
   to 16 October), we estimated a passage of 507 667 (95\% C.I. +/- 84 680)
   King and 111 635 (95\% C.I. +/- 42 440) Common elders westbound. Our
   estimates provide evidence that both populations may have declined since
   1976. Many King Elders were observed in September and October suggesting
   that 1996 was a productive year. Migration counts during late fall at
   Point Barrow may provide a means to monitor King Elder production. King
   Elders appeared at Point Barrow in early May but the peak of Common
   Elder migration occurred later. During summer/fall migration, most male
   and many female King Elders migrated out of the Beaufort Sea to molt,
   whereas approximately 75\% of the Common Elders molted before migrating
   past Point Barrow in September and October. King Elders comprised 85\%
   to 90\% of the identified elder migration, Common Elders comprised most
   of the rest, and very small numbers of Spectacled (Somateria fischeri)
   and Steller's elders (Polysticta stelleri) were seen.}},

Abstract = {{Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) has experienced a substantial decline
   across most of its range in eastern North America over the past century
   and probably also in the disjunct Ontario populations where it now
   occurs only in small isolated stands. Measurements of cone and seed
   traits from natural populations were used as indicators of the
   reproductive and genetic status of red spruce across the northern
   margins of its range in Canada. Cone and seed traits were quantified to
   provide reproductive benchmarks for assessing and monitoring population
   viability. Reduced fecundity and seedling height growth were observed in
   some of the smallest Ontario populations, suggesting some inbreeding
   depression in both vegetative and reproductive components of fitness.
   Nevertheless, the reproductive status of these small isolated Ontario
   populations compared favorably with the much larger, more extensive
   Maritime populations in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Significantly
   higher proportions of aborted (nonpollinated) seeds and lower
   proportions of filled seeds suggested poorer pollination conditions in
   the Maritimes in 1996. The proportion of empty seed, which was used to
   estimate inbreeding levels, was significantly and negatively related to
   seedling height growth. In the short-term, the Ontario populations,
   which probably represent relatively recent remnants of a broader past
   distribution, generally appeared to be quite resilient to the effects of
   small population size on fecundity and progeny fitness. In the longer
   term, continuing decline in population sizes and numbers may be expected
   to erode reproductive success and genetic diversity through the effects
   of inbreeding, genetic drift, and changes in mating behavior. The
   reproductive indicators described here have general validity for
   assessing and monitoring reproductive and genetic aspects of population
   viability in conifers.}},

Abstract = {{Red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) has become increasingly rare across
   large portions of its range in eastern North America as a result of a
   general and widespread decline over the past century. Genetic diversity,
   population genetic structure, outcrossing rates in the filled seeds, and
   actual inbreeding levels were characterized in five small, isolated,
   remnant red spruce populations from the disjunct northwestern limits of
   its range in Ontario and five populations from the larger, more
   extensive Maritime populations of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick to
   determine genetic and reproductive status, to provide some benchmarks
   for monitoring genetic changes resulting from isolation and restricted
   population sizes, and to assist the development of restoration and
   conservation strategies. Thirty-seven allozyme loci coding for 15
   enzymes were used for genetic diversity assessments, and six of the most
   polymorphic loci were used for mating system determination. On average,
   29.1\% (95\% criterion) of the loci were polymorphic, the number of
   alleles per locus was 1.60, and the observed and expected
   heterozygosities were 0.097 and 0.100, respectively. The Ontario
   populations were comparable to or slightly less genetically variable
   than those from the Maritimes. Only 4.7\% of the detected genetic
   variation was among stands; the remainder was among individuals within
   stands. The Maritime populations were genetically less differentiated
   from each other than those in Ontario. With the exception of three
   Maritime populations clustering tightly in one group, there was no clear
   separation of Ontario red spruce populations from Maritime red spruce
   populations based on genetic distance as well as canonical discriminant
   analyses. The average multilocus (t(m)) and single-locus (t(s))
   population outcrossing rates were 0.595 and 0.558, respectively,
   indicating a comparatively high tolerance for inbreeding up to the
   filled seed stage of development in red spruce. The Ontario populations,
   on average, showed higher outcrossing rates (t(m) = 0.654, t(s) = 0.641)
   than the Maritime populations (t(m) = 0.535, t(s) = 0.475). Individual
   family outcrossing rates were similar to their respective population
   outcrossing rates and no significant differences were observed among
   families within populations for the multilocus estimates. When such high
   levels of inbreeding in filled seeds were combined with the proportions
   of empty (post-pollination-aborted) seeds, it appears that actual
   inbreeding levels may vary from 48 to 86\%. The highest inbreeding
   levels occurred in the smallest, most isolated Ontario populations and
   in those populations most likely to have been affected by poorer
   pollination conditions. Allozyme variation indicates that in the short
   term, extant remnants of Ontario red spruce have maintained their
   genetic diversity and integrity. For artificial restoration of red
   spruce in Ontario, local seed sources could be used without undue
   concern over losses of genetic diversity. However, over the longer term,
   genetic drift and inbreeding may be expected to result in further losses
   of genetic diversity and (or) reproductive fitness if population sizes,
   numbers, and distribution continue to decline.}},

Abstract = {{Among factors that may limit population size, nest site is generally
   considered important for cavity-nesting species. We tested the
   hypothesis that nest-site availability limits population size in the
   southern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans) by examining the effect of
   experimentally increasing the number of nest sites. We compared
   population sizes before and after adding 100 nest boxes (high-quality
   nests, increasing overall nest density by at least about 65\%) on each
   of three experimental sites on the Savannah River Site in South
   Carolina. We also compared the experimental populations with three
   reference (unmanipulated) sites in a paired-block experimental design.
   All six populations were similarly monitored with livetrapping grids,
   and flying squirrels readily nested in the supplemental boxes. We
   predicted that population size would increase where nest sites were
   added. No increases in population size were observed after nest boxes
   were added to the three experimental sites, however, nor were
   populations higher on the experimental sites than on the reference
   sites. The lack of increase in population size after nest boxes were
   added demonstrates that the availability of nest sites was not limiting
   the size of these populations.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental epidemiology is the specialized aspect of public health
   science that studies human health risk from environmental hazards. It is
   rises largely upon a foundation of public health surveillance, and
   relies heavily upon analyses of data for small areas and sparse
   population groups. To a degree, environmental epidemiology is assigned
   the role of discerning very subtle human health impacts, or discerning
   early evidence of a tragic sequence. In that context, environmental
   epidemiology has a substantial public education and risk communication
   role. Environmental epidemiology will be greatly advanced as effective
   biological markers of exposure and precursor health effects are
   developed. At this point in time, statistical methods are in place to
   monitor population-level disease rates in high-risk populations for
   early risk identification and sentinel event recognition. Advances in
   geographic methods have provided a boon to the discipline by advantaging
   spatial studies. These advances in the discipline still need further
   refinement and pilot experiences. The inclusion of environmental
   epidemiological considerations with instances of proposed industrial
   expansion, hazardous waste management, and contamination remediation is
   heartily recommended. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of prolonged (9 week) nutrient enrichment on the growth and
   photosynthetic rates of the zooxanthellate coral Stylophora pistillata
   was investigated. The main questions were: (1) what is the exposure time
   needed to induce measurable change in growth rate? (2) which are the
   concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus required to cause changes in
   these rates? (3) what is the recovery potential of the corals after the
   nutrient stress? For this purpose, three tanks (N, P, NP) were enriched
   with ammonium (N), phosphorus (P) or both nutrients (NP), respectively.
   A fourth tank (C) served as a control. The growth of 40 nubbins (10 in
   each tank) was monitored during four periods: period 1 (nutrient-poor
   conditions), period 2 (10 mu M NH4 and/or mu M PO4 enrichment), period 3
   (20 mu M NH4 and/or 2 mu M PO4) and period 4 (nutrient-poor conditions).
   Period 4 was performed to study the recovery potential of corals after a
   nutrient stress. During period 1, growth rates remained constant in all
   tanks. In the P tank, growth rates declined during the two enrichment
   periods, with a total decrease of 60\% by the end of period 3. In the N
   tank, growth rates remained nearly constant during period 2 but
   decreased in period 3 (60\% decrease). In the NP tank, 50\% and 25\%
   decreases were observed during periods 2 and 3. At the end of the
   recovery period, a regain in growth rate was observed in the N and NP
   tanks (35 and 30\% increase, respectively, compared with the rates
   measured at the end of period 3) and growth rates returned to 60\% of
   the initial rates. By contrast, in the P tank, there was no regain in
   growth and a further decrease of 5\% was observed. Rates of
   photosynthesis were often higher during the enriched than the
   nutrient-poor period (up to 150\% increase). Corals with the highest
   percent increases in maximal gross photosynthetic rate (P-max(g)) had
   the smallest decreases in growth rate due to nutrient enrichment. In
   conclusion, high ammonium (20 mu M) and relatively low phosphorus
   concentrations (2 mu M) are required to induce a significant decrease in
   coral growth rate. The largest reduction was observed with both ammonium
   and phosphorus enrichment. The decrease in growth rate was rapid
   following nutrient enrichment, since a 10\% decrease or more could be
   observed after the first week of treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of estuarine habitats is essential for the conservation and
   recovery of depressed Pacific salmon populations. However, assessing the
   functions of recently restored habitat poses a number of problems
   because of the transitory occurrence of salmonids in any one location.
   We propose assessment criteria and metrics that are based on the
   habitat's capacity, opportunity, and realized function to enhance
   survivability of juvenile salmon. Because of the paucity of data
   relating capacity and opportunity attributes to realized function (e.g.
   growth, consumption rate, survival), there continues to he a need for
   manipulative experiments to assess the developmental status of
   restoration sites. Such a self-monitoring approach of letting the fish
   diagnose the ecological state of restoration would effectively address
   the small-scale, site-specific assessment goals and criteria, but
   ignores the larger-scale issues relating to the ability of diverse
   salmon species and life histories to occupy estuarine habitat
   landscapes. If coastal restoration is going to contribute the recovery
   of anadromous salmonid populations, a landscape perspective is
   fundamental to restoration planning, implementation, and particularly
   assessment. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Artificially assembled and maintained trophic systems require real-time
   measurement and control of environmental and biological variables,
   either because these are part of the system's purpose, as it occurs in
   biosensing, or because they are needed for performance and stability, as
   in closed ecological life support systems (CELSS). The design of control
   strategies needed in these two cases benefit from a model of the system
   dynamics. As an example, we modelled closed-loop controllers of a
   two-level artificial aquatic trophic system consisting of a cladoceran
   population feeding on algae supplied from a culture. The control of the
   cladoceran is based on a stage-structured model of its population
   dynamics and the food density, obtained as a balance of the rates of
   supply from the algae culture and of consumption by the cladoceran. The
   animal model assumes that females switch from asexual to sexual
   reproduction at low food density. The control strategy maintains the
   animal population in the asexual cycle and is based on two controllers.
   One to limit animal population growth by harvesting in accordance to
   food supply availability and another to adjust food supply in order to
   maintain the food density at a. constant reference level above the
   threshold for sexual reproduction. Both controllers require real-time
   estimates of food density and total animal density; however,
   measurements of animal density by stage (adults and neonates) are
   assumed to be unavailable. The second controller, a
   proportional-derivative linear law, maintains the cladoceran in the
   asexual cycle by avoiding changes in reproductive behavior due to lack
   of adequate food density. The first controller calculates a harvest rate
   based on departures of the food consumption from a reference value,
   which was selected conservatively as only a fraction of food supply
   availability. Two alternative designs, linear and nonlinear, for the
   harvest controller were simulated and compared. Simulations of the model
   system (controllers, animal and food) are employed to investigate the
   effect of the controllers on short-term stability and transient
   behavior. All simulations started from zero animal density and a pulse
   inoculation of resting eggs ready to hatch. After post-inoculation
   transients, sudden changes in the consumption reference were also
   implemented to evaluate tracking response to these changes. As expected,
   the nonlinear control yielded better consumption rate transient behavior
   for both post-inoculation and tracking. Animal density fluctuations
   during the post inoculation period were not dampened due to the
   conservative assumptions of unavailability of real-time measurements of
   density by stage. We conclude that this control strategy is feasible but
   that further work is needed for implementation. In future work, we plan
   to address issues that limit current applicability of the model:
   generate real data for calibration and validation, extend controls to
   long-term behavior, and include other limiting factors and processes.

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Associational resistance occurs when herbivore damage to a focal plant
   is reduced by the presence of other plant species. Neighboring plants
   can reduce herbivore damage (1) by their effects on the predator
   community, (2) by reducing the ability of herbivores to find their host
   plants, and (3) by reducing the time herbivores remain on their host
   plants. We examined how the presence of the aromatic low shrub Myrica
   gale and of predatory lady beetles affected herbivore damage and
   reproductive output in a population of the perennial herb Lythrum
   salicaria in northern Sweden. An observational study showed that L.
   salicaria growing in Myrica thickets were less damaged by herbivores,
   had a lower abundance of the monophagous, leaf-feeding, chrysomelid
   beetle Galerucella calmariensis, and had higher flower and seed
   production than L. salicaria outside Myrica thickets. To test whether
   these differences could be explained by (a) differences in some aspect
   of plant quality, or (b) differences in predator abundance, we placed
   Dotted L. salicaria within and outside Myrica thickets. To determine
   whether differences in the abundance of G. calmariensis were primarily
   the result of different rates of colonization or emigration, we marked
   adult beetles and placed them on a second set of potted plants in the
   two microhabitats. The results show that differences in herbivore
   abundance, plant damage, and reproductive output between potted L.
   salicaria placed within and outside Myrica thickets were in the same
   direction and of the same magnitude as those observed for naturally
   occurring plants, indicating that the observed patterns were not an
   effect of differences in the chemical composition of the host plant.
   Moreover, we found no support for the hypothesis that a higher abundance
   of insect predators could explain the lower abundance of G. calmariensis
   on L. salicaria in Myrica thickets. On the contrary, lady beetles
   (Coccinella quinqempunctata and Coccinella septempunctata) were observed
   on a greater proportion of the plants placed outside the Myrica
   thickets. The monitoring of marked beetles indicated that differences in
   the abundance of G. calmariensis were the result of a markedly higher
   colonization rate and a somewhat lower emigration rate from L. salicaria
   outside Myrica thickets. Outside the Myrica thickets, the survival of G.
   calmariensis and the magnitude of herbivore damage were lower, and fruit
   and seed output were higher on plants with observations of lady beetles
   than on plants without lady beetles. The results indicate that the
   abundance of the specialist herbivore G. calmariensis, and the herbivore
   damage and reproductive output of its host plant, L. salicaria, are
   affected both by the presence of the nonhost Myrica and by predation
   From lady beetles. We suggest that the most likely mechanism causing
   decreased feeding on L. salicaria growing in Myrica thickets is that

Abstract = {{The spatial distribution of seeds can influence several parameters of
   the natural regeneration of plant populations. Factors shaping seedfall
   patterns have been typically explored from the tree perspective (seed
   shadow) or from the population perspective (seed rain). However, the
   seed rain is actually composed of multiple seed shadows. In this paper,
   we use this framework to explore the variables shaping the seedfall
   pattern of the wild olive tree (Olea europaea var. sylvestris), a
   fleshy-fruited tree of the Mediterranean scrublands. We monitored the
   movement patterns of avian seed dispersers and the seedfall around each
   fruit-bearing O. europaea tree in two contrasting sites, differing in
   the degree of human management and abundance of scrub cover.
   None of the seed dispersers moved between microhabitats (different shrub
   species and open interspaces) as a function of microhabitat relative
   abundance. All dispersers foraged preferentially at O. europaea; only
   the smaller species visited open interspaces, and these only
   sporadically.
   Avoidance of open sites by frugivores, especially larger species, and
   their attraction to source trees were the major determinants of the
   seedfall pattern. Regarding seed size distribution among microhabitats,
   we found that only small seeds were significantly overrepresented in
   open interspaces. From the seed shadow perspective, seed density under
   trees was similar in the: two study sites, but it decreased with
   distance at a higher rate in the disturbed scrubland. From the seed rain
   perspective, seed density was significantly different among
   microhabitats, with open interspaces collecting few, if any, seeds, and
   places under source trees receiving the highest densities.
   Results from seed shadow and seed rain analyses were integrated to
   construct a path model to explore the relative contribution of spatial,
   microhabitat, and individual tree features to the seedfall pattern.
   Factors related to microhabitat were identified as having a major role
   in shaping seedfall pattern. Open interspaces collected few seeds,
   points under shrub species with sparse foliage collected moderate seed
   densities, and points under shrubs with dense foliage collected the
   highest seed densities. The comparison between sites suggests that
   habitat alteration (a reduction of the scrub layer) can lead to
   contrasting seedfall patterns. The occurrence of an abundant scrub layer
   in the well-preserved scrubland allowed a complex pattern of seed rain.
   In contrast, the sparse scrub cover in the disturbed scrubland yielded a
   seedfall pattern composed of multiple seed shadows constrained to the
   vicinity of tree crowns. Thus, our sampling design and analytical
   approach have proved useful in describing the relative importance of the
   set of variables that shapes the complex seedfall pattern of a
   bird-dispersed plant. This seedfall pattern, in turn, is central to the
   understanding of the spatial patterns of plant recruitment and the
   efficiency of the dispersal mutualism.}},

Abstract = {{The dispersal ability of seeds, spores, and larvae can greatly influence
   spatial heterogeneity in the abundance of plants and sedentary animals,
   especially after a severe and widespread disturbance has caused
   extensive population declines and opened large areas for colonization by
   propagules. However, little work has been done on the relationship
   between propagule dispersal and spatial heterogeneity in species
   abundance. We hypothesize that, shortly after a disturbance, spatial
   variability in abundance of sedentary organisms is negatively related to
   the dispersal potential of a species' propagules, and that this negative
   relationship diminishes over time as populations recover from the
   disturbance. To evaluate this hypothesis, we examined temporal changes
   in spatial patterns of abundance in a diverse group of sedentary marine
   organisms, whose propagules differ greatly in dispersal potential. The
   data set was derived from long-term monitoring of the kelp forest
   communities of Channel Islands National Park and contained annual
   estimates of abundance of 27 species from nine phyla collected at 16
   sites on five different islands during 1986-1994. Among-site variability
   in the abundance of plants and animals was negatively related to the
   plank tonic duration of a species' propagules. The negative relationship
   disappeared over time in some regions, but not in others. This
   disappearance resulted primarily from species with relatively limited
   dispersal becoming more uniformly distributed over time; among-site
   variability of species with more widespread dispersal changed little.
   Differences among regions in the rate at which the negative relationship
   diminished over time suggested regional differences in rates of recovery
   from the 1982-1984 El Nino disturbance. These differences among regions
   may have resulted in part from differences in the frequency and
   intensity of sea urchin grazing, and in part from regional differences
   in the distances separating sites where abundances were measured. Our
   findings support the hypothesis that differential dispersal after large
   disturbances can significantly influence spatial heterogeneity in
   assemblages of sedentary organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Recently Don Ludwig has shown that calculations of extinction
   probabilities based on currently available data are often meaningless
   due to the large uncertainty accompanying the estimates. Here we address
   two questions posed by his findings. Can one ever calculate extinction
   probabilities accurately? If so, how much data would be necessary? Our
   analysis indicates that reliable predictions of long-term extinction
   probabilities are likely to require unattainable amounts of data.
   Analytic calculations based on diffusion approximations indicate that
   reliable predictions of extinction probabilities can be made only for
   short-term time horizons (10\% to 20\% as long as the period over which
   the population has been monitored). Simulation results for unstructured
   and structured populations (three stage classes) agree with these
   calculations.}},

Abstract = {{Kin competition is known to strongly influence the spacing behaviour of
   juveniles in the common lizard, a species which is only weakly social
   and has no parental care. We examined whether variation in offspring
   dispersal propensity was associated with variation in their ability to
   discriminate odours of their mothers versus unknown females. We caught
   pregnant females in two populations and reared them in the laboratory
   until parturition. Just after birth, we recorded the juvenile response
   to the odour of either their mother or an unrelated female. Mothers and
   offspring were then released at the mother's last capture point, and
   juvenile movement was monitored by recapture for 2 years. Philopatric
   individuals were more attracted to the odour of their mother and more
   repulsed by the odour of an unrelated female than dispersers. In this
   species, ability to discriminate maternal cues appears to be implied in
   the spacing behaviour of juveniles. Since juvenile males and females
   reacted in the same way, the main role of mother discrimination is
   likely to be the avoidance of kin competition by promoting juvenile
   dispersal. This does not necessary require mother discrimination to
   imply mother recognition, or not to be implied in other functions such
   as inbreeding avoidance. Further research is needed to clarify these
   points. We suggest that context-dependent kin discrimination may be
   involved in the spacing behaviour of a large number of species, even for
   those species where ether social functions for kin discrimination have
   been proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Tris(4-chlorophenyl)methane (TCPMe) and tris(4-chlorophenyl)methanol
   (TCPMOH) are among the most recently identified environmental
   contaminants. Despite their widespread contamination in the marine
   environment, human exposure to these compounds remains relatively
   unknown. We determined the concentrations of TCPMe, TCPMOH, and other
   persistent organochlorines such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT
   and its metabolites, hexachlorocyclohexane isomers, hexachlorobenzene,
   and chlordane compounds (CHLs) in human adipose tissue from Japan. TCPMe
   and TCPMOH were detected in all of the adipose samples analyzed; the
   concentrations ranged from 2.5-21 and 1.1-18 ng/g lipid weight,
   respectively. Concentrations of TCPMe and TCPMOH in humans were less
   than those reported in marine mammals, suggesting the possibility of
   metabolism and elimination of these compounds by humans. Significant
   correlation between TCPMe and TCPMOH with concentrations of DDT and its
   metabolites in human adipose tissues suggested that exposure to DDT is
   the source of TCPMe and TCPMOH in humans. The age- and sex-dependent
   accumulation of TCPMe and TCPMOH as well as other organochlorines was
   less pronounced. Results for other organochlorines indicated that recent
   contamination status of PCBs in human samples from Japan was higher than
   that in developing countries, whereas DDT contamination is lower.
   Greater concentrations of CHLs in human adipose tissue from Japan than
   in those from other countries suggest that continuous monitoring of CHLs
   in humans in Japan is necessary. To our knowledge, this is the first
   study on the accumulation of TCPMe and TCPMOH in human adipose tissue.}},

Abstract = {{In response to concerns about amphibian declines, a study evaluating and
   validating amphibian monitoring techniques was initiated in Shenandoah
   and Big Bend National Parks in the spring of 1998. We evaluate
   precision, bias, and efficiency of several sampling methods for
   terrestrial and streamside salamanders in Shenandoah National Park and
   assess salamander abundance in relation to environmental variables,
   notably soil and water pH. Terrestrial salamanders, primarily redback
   salamanders (Plethodon cinereus), were sampled by searching under cover
   objects during the day in square plots (10 to 35 m(2)). We compared
   population indices (mean daily and total counts) with adjusted
   population estimates from capture-recapture. Analyses suggested that the
   proportion of salamanders detected (p) during sampling varied among
   plots, necessitating the use of adjusted population estimates. However,
   adjusted population estimates were less precise than population indices,
   and may not be efficient in relating salamander populations to
   environmental variables. In future sampling, strategic use of
   capture-recapture to verify consistency of p's among sites may be a
   reasonable compromise between the possibility of bias in estimation of
   population size and deficiencies due to inefficiency associated with the
   estimation of p. The streamside two-lined salamander (Eurycea
   bislineata) was surveyed using four methods: leaf litter refugia bags, 1
   m(2) quadrats, 50 x 1 m visual encounter transects, and electric
   shocking. Comparison of survey methods at nine streams revealed
   congruent patterns of abundance among sites, suggesting that relative
   bias among the methods is similar, and that choice of survey method
   should be based on precision and logistical efficiency. Redback and
   two-lined salamander abundance were not significantly related to soil or
   water pH, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), as part of the
   Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP), initiated a
   sample survey of streams in the mid-Atlantic. A major objective of the
   survey was to quantify ecological condition in wadeable streams across
   the region. To accomplish this goal, we selected 615 stream sites using
   a randomized sampling design with some restrictions. The design utilized
   the digitized stream network taken from 1:100,000-scale USGS topographic
   maps as the sample frame. Using a GIS, first- through third-order
   (wadeable) stream segments in the sample frame were randomly laid out in
   a line and sampled at fixed intervals after a random start. We used a
   variable probability approach so that roughly equal numbers of first-,
   second-, and third-order stream sites would appear in the sample. The
   sample design allows inference from the sample data to the status of the
   entire 230,400 km of wadeable stream length in the mid-Atlantic study
   area. Of this mapped stream length, 10\% was not in the target
   population because no stream channel existed (4\%), the stream channel
   was dry (5\%), or the stream was not wadeable (1\%). We were unable to
   collect field data from another 10\% of the mapped stream length due to
   lack of access (mostly landowner denials). Thus, the field data we
   collected at 509 sites allows inference to the ecological condition for
   184,600 km of the mapped stream length in the region.}},

Abstract = {{In the early 1990s, EPA's Environmental Monitoring and Assessment
   Program (EMAP) documented the ecological condition of the overall
   population of small estuaries along the mid-Atlantic coast of the United
   States. However, the Program did not provide detailed information on the
   condition of individual estuaries less than 260 km(2) in surface area, a
   group of estuaries of concern to environmental managers. To address the
   needs of environmental managers, when EMAP returned to the region in
   summer 1997, it included a study of the spatial variability of
   ecological indicators within individual small estuaries. At 127
   probability-based sites in 10 estuaries, EMAP measured a variety of
   parameters of water quality and sediments, including dissolved oxygen
   (DO), nutrients, grain size of sediments, contaminants in sediments, and
   community structures of benthic macroinvertebrates. From this
   information the ecological condition (e.g., percent area with DO
   concentrations below 5mg L-1) for each estuary, along with 90\%
   confidence interval, was determined. The width of the confidence
   interval was then recalculated for sample sizes ranging from two
   stations to the total number of stations sampled in that estuary.
   Confidence interval widths were then plotted against sample size. These
   plots can be useful in designing future regional monitoring programs
   with a goal of describing conditions in individual systems as well as
   broad geographic regions. Results illustrate that beyond five stations
   per estuary, the reduction in the width of the confidence interval with
   increasing sampling intensity is relatively small; however, individual
   program managers need to determine ``how small is small enough.{''}}},

Abstract = {{The population counts of hydrocarbon-utilising yeasts were monitored at
   six sampling stations in the Benin City municipal area over a four-week
   period. Although the population counts were relatively constant in each
   locality, the highest counts occurred in areas heavily polluted by
   domestic and industrial effluents. A total of thirty-five
   hydrocarbon-degrading yeasts were isolated from soil at the sampling
   stations using n-hexadecane as sole carbon source. The isolates were
   identified as belonging to the genera Candida (27 strains), Endomycopsis
   (4 strains). All the organisms grew on long-chain n-alkane, kerosene,
   diesel oil and crude oil but failed to grow on short-chain n-alkane,
   aromatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons. Measurement of growth attributes of
   the isolates using n-hexadecane, diesel oil and crude oil as substrates
   showed that the Candida species were better utilizers of hydrocarbon
   substrates relative to Endomycopsis and Schizosaccharomyces species.}},

Abstract = {{1. Radio-telemetry and mark-recapture methods were used to study the
   summer movements of adult and juvenile white-clawed crayfish,
   Austropotamobius pallipes from a wild population in a small braided
   stream, Dalton Beck, North Yorkshire, U.K. Radio-transmitters were
   attached to the chelae of 18 large (> 35 mm carapace length) crayfish
   and individuals were subsequently located to within 0.15 m. Additionally
   a total of 888 crayfish were marked with carapace brands, and 83 were
   recaptured.
   2. Radio-tracked crayfish exhibited significantly greater local activity
   at dusk (21.00-00.00) than at dawn (03.00-06.00), or during morning
   (09.00-12.00) and afternoon (15.00-18.00) monitoring periods.
   3. The greatest movements of radio-tracked crayfish occurred within 2
   days of release. After this time, periods of residence were interspersed
   by movements to new locations, interpreted as establishment of ephemeral
   home areas. It is suggested that the initial large movements were the
   result of a `fright response' following capture.
   4. Movements varied widely between individuals, some moving more than
   300 m in 10 days, while others showed little movement over an equivalent
   time period. Mean (+/- SE) daily movements were 4.6 +/- 3.0 m for males
   and 1.5 +/- 1.0 m for females. Although crayfish often used specific
   home sites for in excess of 7 days, displaced animals did not return to
   home sites.
   5. The total distances travelled and the mean distance travelled per day
   by individual radio-tagged crayfish did not differ significantly between
   upstream or downstream directions or between males and females. This was
   also the case for marked crayfish used in mark-recapture studies.
   6. Positive correlations between distance moved per day and size
   (carapace length) were found for downstream movements by male and female
   crayfish, but not for upstream movements.
   7. Some preliminary observations of the response of crayfish to flood
   events suggested that these could be catastrophic with two out of five
   tracked crayfish found dead after a high stream-discharge event.}},

Abstract = {{The Monfalcone area, northeastern Italy, is a small industrial district
   (population 60,000), with a large shipyard. In order to monitor asbestos
   exposure in this area, a series of 3,640 necropsies, carried out at the
   Monfalcone Hospital between October 1979 and September 1998, were
   investigated. The thoracic cavities were examined for pleural plaques;
   these were classified into three classes (small, moderate, large).
   Routine histological sections of lung tissue were examined for asbestos
   bodies. Isolation and counting of asbestos bodies were performed in
   1,075 cases. Lifetime occupational data were collected in 1,277 cases.
   Pleural plaques were observed in 70.5\% among men and in 23.8\% among
   women. The prevalences of pleural plaques did not show significant
   variations during the study period. Asbestos bodies were found on
   routine lung sections in 23.7\% of men and 3.0\% of women. The shipyard
   workers, the most numerous category in the series, were characterized by
   high prevalence of pleural plaques (total 86.7\%, large 32.4\%), high
   prevalence of asbestos bodies on routine lung sections (35.3\%), and
   high amounts of lung asbestos bodies after isolation. The present data
   indicate that asbestos exposure may reach alarming levels in the
   shipyard areas.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effect of prescribed wet-season fire on the
   demography of Zamia pumila L. (Zamiaceae) in slash pine savanna of
   Everglades National park, Florida. We monitored survival, coning, leaf
   production, and herbivore damage on two plots burned during the wet
   season of 1995 and on two unburned plots. Fire killed all leaves and
   promoted the flushing of new leaves but caused minimal mortality of
   adults and seedlings. Seeds within cones were killed, but some dispersed
   seeds survived. Coning, particularly of females, was enhanced in the
   plot that burned earlier and hotter. Larvae of Seirarctia echo appeared
   on new leaves within 1 mo postfire and were present at higher density on
   burned plots. Herbivore damage was significantly greater on burned plots
   for the first wet season following the fire, with many plants completely
   defoliated. This defoliation, which was more frequent in the plot burned
   late in the wet season, resulted in mortality of some adults but
   promoted greater leaf production in the remainder. Seirarctia echo
   consumed some Zamia cones, cancelling the positive effect of fire on
   reproduction. Overall, the combined direct and indirect effects of
   wet-season fires on Zamia was positive for the early wet-season fire but
   negative for the late wet-season fire because of reduced coning and
   increased mortality following herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We used data from the annual Fourth of July Butterfly Count for the
   years 1989-97 to examine patterns of species richness and total
   butterfly abundance across North America and within topographically
   diverse and disturbed landscapes.
   Location We analysed counts from 514 different locations in North
   America. The counts represent all areas of the USA and southern Canada,
   with a few Mexican sites as well, although most counts were in the
   eastern USA.
   Methods First, we standardized published count data according to the
   effort expended per count (total party-hours). Using regression analysis
   and analysis of variance, we then examined the impact of latitude,
   longitude, topographical relief, habitat disturbance and different
   climatic measures on the species richness and total abundance of
   butterflies per count. We also examined the abundance of exotic species
   in disturbed landscapes.
   Results Our analyses suggest that: (1) species richness is highest at
   low latitudes and near Rocky Mountain longitudes; (2) the total
   abundance of individuals is highest in northern US latitudes and Great
   Plains longitudes; (3) species richness but not total abundance
   increases with greater topographical relief; (4) species richness and
   diversity indices are lower in more disturbed habitats; and (5) the
   abundance of the introduced Pieris rapae (L.) is greater in more
   disturbed habitats.
   Main conclusions Different factors control the abundance and species
   richness of North American butterflies. Along with geographical
   location, habitat disturbance and topographical variability affect
   species richness. Our analysis also shows the value of broad-based
   monitoring regimes, such as the North American Fourth of July Butterfly
   Count.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated previously that the sex pheromone of the
   Israeli pine bast scale, Matsucoccus josephi,
   (2E,5R,6E,8E)-5,7-dimethyl-2,6,8-decatrien-4-one (1) is also a potent
   kairomone of the scale insect's predator Elatophilus hebraicus.
   Surprisingly, the sex pheromones of M. feytaudi (2) and M. matsumurae
   (3) also attract E. hebraicus. These results have prompted us to prepare
   a series of analogs of 1 with variations in the two moieties attached to
   the C=O group (4-9) in order to probe the structure-activity
   relationship of the pheromonal/kairomonal response of M. josephi and E,
   hebraicus. The most selective and active pheromone analog is 8,
   attracting only M. josephi males and the most selective and active
   kairomone analog is the M. feytaudi pheromone 2, attracting only adults
   of E. hebraicus. A dose-response field test of these analogs and the
   chiral and racemic M. josephi pheromone 1 indicates that the specificity
   is maintained at a broad range between 25 and 400 mu g corresponding to
   1. Analog 5, which is neither a parapheromone nor a kairomone, and
   analog 8, which is only a parapheromone, are not inhibitory to M.
   josephi or to E. hebraicus. Our study indicates that alterations in the
   diene side chain of 1, common to all three Matsucoccus pheromones,
   strongly reduce the kairomonal activity while structural changes in the
   second side chain significantly reduce the pheromonal activity. The
   discovery of selective analogs of 1 has practical implications and
   enables specific monitoring of M. josephi or 6 hebraicus. Particularly
   important is the possibility to mass-trap males of M. josephi without
   reducing the population of E. hebraicus.}},

Abstract = {{The genetic structure, selfing rate and inbreeding depression of the
   hermaphroditic freshwater snail Physa acuta were jointly analysed in a
   population near Montpellier, France. Allozymic markers revealed moderate
   gene diversity (0.138), and no heterozygote deficiency. The mean
   outcrossing rate, estimated by using progeny arrays, was 0.9, with
   substantial variation among families. This also suggests that the number
   of fathers among outcrossed offspring of a given mother is low.
   Inbreeding depression was estimated over more than one generation using
   83 first-laboratory-generation (G(1)) families. The main parameters
   measured were parental (G(1)) fecundity, offspring (G(2)) survival and
   fecundity. Size and growth were also monitored. Parental fecundity was
   analysed under several conditions (isolation, pair and quadruplet
   outcrossing). The self-fertilization depression, including parental
   fecundity, offspring survival and fecundity, was about 0.9 at the
   population level. The genetic data obtained in the same population
   indicate a value of about 0.3 using Ritland's (1990) technique,
   suggesting that the depression over the whole life-cyle might be even
   higher than 0.9. Grouping affected neither fecundity nor
   self-fertilization depression. Substantial variation in depression for
   survival was detected among individuals, from no survival in some selfed
   families to better survival than that of outbred families in others. The
   overall result (outbred population structure, high outcrossing rate and
   high self-fertilization depression) is consistent with what is expected
   in large outcrossing populations in which inbreeding depression is
   maintained by mutation-selection balance.}},

Abstract = {{A personal air pollution exposure study, EXPOLIS, was accomplished in
   six European cities among 25- to 55-year-old citizens. In order to
   compare the exposure results and different microenvironmental
   concentrations between the cities it is crucial to know the extent and
   effects of the population bias that has developed in sampling procedure
   and the sociodemographic characteristics of each measured population
   sample. In each participating city a random Base sample of 2000 to 3000
   individuals was drawn from the census and a Short Questionnaire (SQ) was
   mailed to them. Two subsamples of the Respondents of the mailed
   questionnaire were randomly drawn: Diary sample for 48-h
   time-microenvironment-activity diary and extensive exposure
   questionnaires, and Exposure sample for the same plus personal exposure
   and microenvironmental monitoring. Significant differences existed
   between the EXPOLIS cities in the population-sampling procedure,
   population-sampling bias was evaluated by comparing the Respondents with
   the total city populations. The share of women and individuals with more
   than 14 years of education is higher among the Respondents than the
   overall population except in Athens. Men, younger (25-34 years old) and
   unmarried individuals were hardest to get to participate in the study at
   least in Helsinki. The two subsamples differ from Respondents in having
   more employed and higher- educated individuals. The largest sample bias
   occurred at the first and easiest step of responding to the mailed Short
   Screening Questionnaire, and not at the last and most demanding stage of
   participating in the exposure measurements. Exposure data from some of
   EXPOLIS cities can only be compared to other cities with caution
   considering their large population bias or different sample selections.
   However the selection bias is not necessarily a problem for analyses
   about predictors of personal exposures or analyses within a city.}},

Abstract = {{Newly-harvested wheat stored in each of two bins on each of two farms in
   Kansas during each of 3 years was sampled every 3-4 days at two
   locations (in the center and midway between the center and bin wall)
   within each bin. The variation in insect numbers between bins, locations
   within a bin, farms and years differed with insect species and sampling
   method. Five sampling methods were used to monitor insect populations in
   three regions of each bin: (1) in the head space above the grain; (2) on
   the grain surface; and (3) within the top 50 cm of the grain mass.
   Cryptolestes ferrugineus (Stephens) and Ahasverus advena (Waltl) were
   more evenly distributed among these three regions of a bin than the
   other species. Typhaea stercorea (L.) were found mainly in the head
   space and on the grain surface. These distribution patterns were
   consistent throughout the 126-day storage period. R. dominica (F.) were
   found in the head space and within the grain mass early in the storage
   period, and mainly in the grain mass as grain cooled in the autumn. The
   majority of Plodia interpunctella (Hubner) (91\%) were caught in sticky
   traps in the head space. Two of the three less abundant species,
   Sitophilus oryzae (L.) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), tended to be
   found most often on the grain surface and the other, Oryzaephilus
   surinamensis (L.), within the grain mass. The sampling method often
   influenced the results. Emergence traps captured greater numbers of A.
   advena than other species. More R. dominica were found in grain samples
   than in traps in the autumn. Pushing probe traps below the surface of
   the grain reduced the numbers of T. stercorea, A. advena, S, oryzae and
   T. castaneum captured. Differences between species and times during the
   storage period in the effectiveness of different sampling methods need
   to be considered in making pest management decisions. Published by

Abstract = {{Elk (Cervus elaphus) are sympatric with mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)
   across large areas of western North America, where populations of mule
   deer have declined while elk populations increased. Insight into the
   interspecific relationships of elk and mule deer requires a clear
   understanding of the patterns of resource selection and spatial
   separation between the 2 species on shared range. Accordingly, we
   monitored distributions of mule deer and elk during spring, 1993-96 at
   the U.S. Forest Service Starkey Experimental Forest and Range (Starkey),
   in northeast Oregon. We recorded animal movements with an automated
   telemetry system (ATS) that provided locations of each radiocollared
   animal about every 1-4 hr, 24 hr/day. We linked animal locations to a
   geographic information system (GIS) of physical, vegetation, and
   human-activity variables identified from the literature as being
   important predictors of distributions of elk or mule deer, and used
   logistic regression to identify which variables best predicted resource
   selection. We validated models of resource selection by comparing
   predicted and observed selection in 2 study areas with 5 data sets of
   animal locations collected during spring, 1993-96. Of the 8 variables
   significant for either deer or elk, 4 variables were significant for 1
   but not the other species, and coefficients (3) for 3 other variables
   differed in sign between the 2 species, demonstrating strong spatial
   separation between elk and mule deer. The resource selection function
   (RSF) for elk was a stronger predictor of mule deer selection than was
   the mule deer RSF as a predictor of elk selection. Mule deer
   distribution was inversely related to elk resource selection, but elk
   distribution was not related to mule deer resource selection. In 4
   vegetation types that dominate Starkey, mule deer electivity index
   {[}(used - availalility)/(used + availability)] declined as elk resource
   selection increased, while elk electivity index was independent of
   resource selection of mule deer. The dichotomy in resource selection
   between the 2 species, combined with the inverse relationship between
   mule deer locations and elk RSF, indicated that mule deer avoided areas
   used by elk. Removal experiments are needed under controlled conditions
   to explicitly test whether mule deer avoidance of elk results in
   decreased population or individual performance of deer.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the irruptive potential of a roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
   population on a 10-km(2) island 2 km off the coast of central Norway (63
   degrees 40' N). As roe deer density increased from 10 to 34.5
   animals/km(2) from spring 1991 to spring 1994, reproductive status was
   determined in 33 2-year old and 66 adult, radiocollared does. Body mass
   was known for 19 adults and 12 2-year old females. The studied
   population had a high overall rate of increase, r = 0.409, although this
   decreased with increasing population density. Density only explained
   2.8\% and 6.7\% of the variation in maternal body mass of 2-year olds
   and adults, respectively, and an examination of individual trajectories
   showed that density did not affect litter size either. Body mass did not
   affect reproductive status in the 2 age groups; however, body mass
   affected the number of fawns produced. Females with above average body
   mass had 40\% higher productivity than females with below average body
   mass. The ability of female roe deer to maintain high body condition and
   high reproductive rates at high density means that monitoring of vital
   rates alone will not allow managers to detect these potential rapid
   increases in density until they have irrupted. Therefore, direct
   monitoring of population size or an index of population abundance is
   needed to allow rapid changes in harvest level that can prevent
   irruptions.}},

Abstract = {{Using maximum likelihood estimators (in genetic stock identification),
   we used genetic markers to evaluate the utility of 2 morphological
   measures (culmen length and plumage color) to correctly identify groups
   of hunter-harvested dusky (Branta canadensis occidentalis) and
   dusky-like Canada geese on the wintering grounds within the Pacific
   Flyway. Significant levels of genetic differentiation were observed
   across all sampled breeding sites for both nuclear microsatellite loci
   and mtDNA when analyzed at the sequence level. The ability to
   discriminate among geese from these sites using genetic markers was
   further demonstrated using computer simulations. We estimated
   contributions from the Copper River Delta, the primary breeding area of
   dusky Canada geese, to groups of hunter-harvested geese classified as
   dusky Canada geese on the basis of morphology as 50.6 +/- 10.1(SE)\% for
   females and 50.3 +/- 13.0\% for males. We also estimated that 16 +/-
   8.1\% of females classified as dusky Canada geese on the basis of
   morphology originated from Middleton Island, Alaska; a locale currently
   managed as a subpopulation of dusky Canada geese, even though the
   majority of geese from this area possess a unique mtDNA haplotype not
   found on the Copper River Delta. The use of culmen length and plumage
   color to identify the origin of breeding populations in the harvest
   provides conservative criteria for management of dusky Canada geese as
   individuals of other breeding populations are misassigned as dusky
   Canada geese and birds of the lighter-plumaged dusky-like group did not
   appear to originate from breeding sites of the dusky Canada goose. Our
   analyses demonstrate that genetic markers can accurately estimate the
   proportion of genetically differentiated areas that comprise an admired
   group, but they also raise questions about the management scale of
   Pacific Flyway Canada geese (e.g., at the subspecies or breeding
   population level) and the use of morphological and genetic
   characteristics to monitor the harvest of different populations within
   admired wintering Rocks.}},

Abstract = {{Arisaema triphyllum (L.) Schott, Jack-in-the-pulpit, a sequential
   hermaphrodite, can switch between male and female sex expression through
   time. Older, larger individuals are more likely to become female, but
   damage to leaves or storage tissue may prevent future sexual
   reproduction. Therefore repeated herbivory could indirectly alter sex
   ratios within populations. In a field study in hardwood forests in New
   Jersey, we observed lower than expected flower and fruit production by
   A. triphyllum in a large sample. The energy reserves of the corms within
   the study populations may have been depleted by chronic herbivory from
   white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman), decreasing the
   likelihood of flower and fruit production. We found that 27.2\% of the
   3331 monitored A. triphyllum individuals were eaten by white-tailed deer
   in 1996. Although herbivory by deer declined in 1997 and 1998, long-term
   effects of repeated overgrazing by deer may result in irreversible
   losses of plants that fail to reproduce. Therefore, monitoring based
   only on counting stems may lead to misleading estimates for
   population-persistence of gender-modifying plants. Similarly, a count of
   flowers in a predominantly male-biased population is a misleading
   indicator of reproductive potential.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty-five kilograms of wheat, at 16 and 17\% moisture content (MC)
   were treated with `Dryacide', a diatomaceous earth, at 3 and 5g kg(-1)
   and stored in metal bins. The bins were then infested with mixed
   populations of mites (Acarus sire and Lepidoglyphus destructor) and
   insects (Sitophilus granarius and Oryzaephilus surinamensis) at
   approximately 100 and 10 per kg, respectively. The grain was held at a
   constant temperature of 15 degrees C and relative humidities of 75 and
   80\%, chosen to simulate bulk surface conditions in UK stores, and
   monitored for 42 weeks. At 16\% MC, the mite and insect populations were
   suppressed within 2 and 13 weeks, respectively, at both doses. At 17\%
   MC, the mites took 5 weeks to die out and F-1 adults of S granarius
   emerging within 22 weeks were controlled after a further 5 weeks. After
   23 weeks the bins were re-infested with mites and these were completely
   suppressed after a further 3 weeks. There was no decline in efficacy
   throughout the experiment. (C) Crown Copyright 2000.Reproduced with the

Abstract = {{Experimental and modelling work suggests a strong dependence of olive
   flowering date on spring temperatures. Since airborne pollen
   concentrations reflect the flowering phenology of olive populations
   within a radius of 50 km, they may be a sensitive regional indicator of
   climatic warming. We assessed this potential sensitivity with phenology
   models fitted to flowering dates inferred from maximum airborne pollen
   data. Of four models tested, a thermal time model gave the best fit for
   Montpellier, France, and was the most effective at the regional scale,
   providing reasonable predictions for 10 sites in the western
   Mediterranean. This model was forced with replicated future temperature
   simulations for the western Mediterranean from a coupled
   ocean-atmosphere general circulation model (GCM). The GCM temperatures
   rose by 4.5 degrees C between 1990 and 2099 with a 1\% per year increase
   in greenhouse gases, and modelled flowering date advanced at a rate of
   6.2 d per degrees C. The results indicated that this long-term regional
   trend in phenology might be statistically significant as early as 2030,
   but with marked spatial variation in magnitude, with the calculated
   flowering date between the 1990s and 2030s advancing by 3-23 d. Future
   monitoring of airborne olive pollen may therefore provide an early
   biological indicator of climatic warming in the Mediterranean.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate the link between river flow, nutrient availability and
   development of algal blooms, growth rates of the major phytoplankton
   species were examined in situ in the lower River Murray, South Australia
   over the 1994/1995 summer. Eight sites were selected over a 54 km reach
   between Lock 1 and Nildottie and growth rates estimated by monitoring
   mean cell density in time-aligned `parcels' of water as they travelled
   downstream. Discharge at Lock 1 during the period of study (3000-5000 ML
   day(-1)) typified summer entitlement flows to South Australia. A large,
   shallow floodplain lake (lagoon), with an hydraulic connection to the
   river, supported a large population of cyanobacteria in summer, but
   inputs to the main channel did not substantially affect the abundance
   and composition of river phytoplankton. Mean net growth rates of
   Anabaena circinalis and A. flos-aquae f. flos-aquae were 0.132 and 0.176
   day(-1), respectively, although individual rates varied from positive to
   negative. In contrast, the mean growth rate of the filamentous diatom
   Aulacoseira granulata was -0.15 day(-1), reflecting a decrease in
   population size with advection downstream. Mean cell densities of the
   three species did not exceed 5000 cells mL(-1) throughout the study.
   Growth bioassays conducted in the laboratory indicated that nitrogen was
   often the nutrient limiting algal growth, although it was not
   established whether nitrogen was limiting in situ. A conceptual model is
   presented, linking these findings with those of other work on the lower
   River Murray, to summarize the physical and chemical environmental
   factors governing the abundance of cyanobacteria in this reach of the
   river. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Aoristic diversity and the vertical distribution of the weed
   seedbank were studied in ridge tillage (RT) and conventional tillage
   (CT) systems in clay and clay loam soils. Viable seedbank populations
   were monitored during 3 yr using germination in a greenhouse.
   Ridge-tilled fields had a larger soil seedbank (2,992 seeds m(-2)) than
   moldboard-plowed fields (1,481 seeds m(-2)) in the top 15 cm. This
   result can be explained by the larger perennial seedbank of RT fields at
   both the 0- to 5-cm and 5- to 15-cm depths. Annual dicot seeds were more
   abundant in clay soils than in clay loams at the two soil depths. Annual
   grass seeds were more abundant under CT than under RT in clay soils ar
   the two sampled depths. In clay loams, the density of annual grass seeds
   in RT fields was six times greater than in CT fields in the top 5 cm of
   soil and two times greater at the 5- to 15-cm depth. The vertical
   distribution of total seeds in soil did not differ between tillage
   systems. The cop 5 cm of the 15-cm soil core contained 35 and 46\% of
   all weed seed in CT and RT systems, respectively. However, the CT system
   had the highest concentration of annual dicot seeds 5 to 15 cm deep,
   whereas in the RT system, the same depth contained the highest
   concentration of perennial seeds. These results confirm that tillage
   systems and soil types can regulate seedbanks. Weed management programs
   must take this information into account.}},

Abstract = {{The only remaining self-sustaining native population of lacustrine
   Lahontan cutthroat trout (Onco rhynchus clarki henshawi) not affected by
   nonnative salmonids is in Summit Lake, Humboldt Count): Nevada. Annual
   spawning runs in 1993 and 1994 were monitored at a fish trap on Mahogany
   Creek, the only spawning tributary for Summit Lake. Number of spawners
   was similar in both years, with 1290 upstream migrants observed in 1993
   and 1255 in 1994. In 1993, 137 postspawners (10.6\% of upstream
   migrants) returned to the lake, and in 1994, 434 postspawners (34.6\% of
   upstream migrants) returned downstream through the fish trap. Two
   distinct, groups of subadult Lahontan cutthroat trout were observed
   moving downstream in 1994. The first group passed downstream between 27
   April and 29 July and included 1188 fish (average folk length = 90 mm).
   Between 1 August and 31 October, 1160 fish (average fork length = 42 mm)
   moved downstream. Size differences of these 2 groups suggest that the
   1st group comprised fish that had overwintered in Mahogany Creek, while
   the 2nd group were probably young-of-the-year.}},

Abstract = {{In this field study we investigated the impact of Argyrodes fissifrons
   (Araneae: Theridiidae) on two species of Cyrtophora spider hosts
   (Araneae: Araneidae) by studying several aspects of its population and
   foraging. We examined (1) if natural population variations of A.
   fissifrons occur with different web sizes of the hosts, (2) if A.
   fissifrons form long-term associations with particular hosts, and (3) if
   the size range of prey consumed by A. fissifrons overlaps with that of
   Cyrtophora hosts. Results from field surveys indicated that a positive
   relationship exists between the average number of A. fissifrons and the
   size of the host webs. The number of A. fissifrons per host web per day
   changed daily, indicating the daily occurrence of immigration-emigration
   events. However, as inferred from monitoring marked A. fissifrons for 3
   nights, some individuals form a long-term association with a particular
   host. The sex ratio, body size, and prey intake of A. fissifrons spiders
   staying in particular hosts' webs during monitoring did not differ from
   those that left a web. A significant difference was found in prey size
   distribution between Cyrtophora hosts and A. fissifrons, and the average
   prey size of the former was far greater than that of the latter. This
   result suggests that A. fissifrons scavenge an webs of Cyrtophora hosts
   by collecting smalt prey ignored by the hosts.}},

Abstract = {{Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV), responsible for the economically
   important court-noue disease, is exclusively transmitted to its natural
   host in the vineyards through Xiphinema nematodes. We have developed
   direct inoculation of GFLV into grapevine through protoplast
   electroporation. Protoplasts were isolated from mesophyll of in
   vitro-grown plants and from embryogenic cell suspensions. Permeation
   conditions were determined by monitoring calcein uptake. Low salt
   poration medium was selected. Electrical conditions leading to strong
   transient gene expression were also tested for GFLV inoculation (isolate
   F13). GFLV replication was detected with either virus particles (2 mu g)
   or viral RNA (10 ng) in both protoplast populations, as shown by
   anti-P38 Western blotting. Direct inoculation and replication were also
   observed with Arabis mosaic virus (ArMV), a closely related nepovirus,
   as well as with another GFLV isolate. These results will be valuable in
   grapevine biotechnology, for GFLV replication studies, transgenic plant
   screening for GFLV resistance, and biorisk evaluation. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present a two-tiered analysis of molecular genetic variation in order
   to determine the origins of `whale' products purchased from retail
   markets in Japan and the Republic of (South) Korea during 1993-1999.
   This approach combined phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA
   sequences for identification of protected species with a statistical
   comparison of intraspecific haplotype frequencies for distinguishing
   regional subpopulations or `stocks' hunted for scientific research by
   the Japanese and killed incidentally in coastal fisheries by the
   Koreans. The phylogenetic identification of 655 products included eight
   species or subspecies of baleen whales, sperm whales, a pygmy sperm
   whale, two species of beaked whales, porpoises, killer whales and
   numerous species of dolphins as well as domestic sheep and horses. Sir;
   of the baleen whale species (the fin, sei, common-form and small-form
   Bryde's, blue or blue/fin hybrid, and humpback) and the sperm whale are
   protected by international agreements dating back to at least 1989 for
   all species and 1966 for some species. We compared the haplotype
   frequencies from the Japanese market sample to those reported from
   scientific hunting in the western North Pacific stock for products
   derived from the exploited North Pacific minke whale. The market sample
   differed significantly from the scientific catch (p < 0.001), showing a
   greater than expected frequency of haplotypes characteristic of the
   protected Sea of Japan stock. We used a `mixed-stock' analysis and
   maximum-likelihood methods to estimate that 31\% (95\% confidence
   interval 19-43\%) of the market for this species originated from the Sea
   of Japan stock. The source of these products was assumed to be
   undocumented `incidental takes' from fisheries' by-catch, although we
   cannot exclude the possibility of illegal hunting or smuggling. The
   demographic impact of this undocumented exploitation was evaluated using
   the model of population dynamics adopted by the Scientific Committee of
   the International Whaling Commission. For the range of exploitation
   consistent with the market sample, this protected stock was predicted to
   decline towards extinction over the next few decades. These results
   confirmed the power of molecular methods in monitoring retail markets
   and pointed to the inadequacy of the current moratorium for ensuring the
   recovery of protected species. More importantly, the integration of
   genetic evidence with a model of population dynamics identified an
   urgent need for actions to limit undocumented exploitation of a
   `protected' stock of whales.}},

Abstract = {{Mercury is a longstanding concern in Maritime Canada due to high levels
   of contamination in a number of fish and bird species. The recycled
   component of past releases of anthropogenic mercury may be a significant
   source of ongoing pollution in many areas. Historical information on
   mercury releases can be used to quantify past and present anthropogenic
   contamination. We present an inventory of historical mercury emissions
   from anthropogenic sources in Maritime Canada for the years 1800-1995.
   Long-term trends in mercury emissions and the significance of the
   cumulative burden of mercury released from local sources are discussed.
   Emissions are calculated using both historical monitoring data and the
   application of emission factors. The nature of current anthropogenic
   sources of mercury is quite different than it was several decades ago
   when many of the existing policies governing mercury pollution were
   created. Our inventory illustrates that many of the most significant
   sources in the past such as the chlor-alkali industry, paint containing
   mercury additives, and pharmaceuticals, have been largely phased out
   with fossil fuel combustion and waste disposal remaining as the most
   significant modern sources. Atmospheric emissions in Maritime Canada
   peaked in 1945 (> 1750 kg year(-1)), and again between 1965 and 1970 (>
   2600 kg year(-1)). Cumulative releases of mercury from anthropogenic
   sources for the years 1800-1995 were between 115 and 259 t to the
   atmosphere alone, and 327-448 t when discharges to wastewater and
   effluents were included. Assuming that only 0.2\% (Nriagu, 1994.) of
   these releases become part of the recycled fraction of current fluxes,
   we estimate that between 570 and 900 kg Hg year(-1) is deposited in
   Maritime Canada from past anthropogenic sources. Modern sources within
   Maritime Canada contribute at least 405 kg year(-1) to the total annual
   deposition of 1.71 t over the provinces of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia
   and Prince Edward Island, leaving similar to 735 kg year(-1) from
   natural sources and long-range contamination. Further study is needed to
   verify these estimates and clarify the significance of natural and
   long-range sources of mercury in Maritime Canada. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We describe life history tactics under laboratory conditions of two
   species of cladocerans of the genus Simocephalus. The populations live
   in two habitats with different characteristics. S. acutirostratus was
   isolated from a small temporary pool without fish. S. latirostris was
   found in the marginal vegetation of a reservoir with fish. Their life
   history was monitored for differences in traits such as clutch size,
   neonate size, age distribution, reproductive effort and adult survival.
   Our results show that S. acutirostratus (the larger-sized species) grows
   until it reaches the optimal foraging size and then begins to reproduce,
   while S. latirostris (the smaller-sized species) starts breeding before
   reaching the optimal foraging size, allocating energy mainly to
   reproduction. We explore the possibility that divergences in life
   history may arise as a response to environmental stress such as that
   produced by fishes.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of an annual pasture community are described from a
   five-year experimental and monitoring study The community was dominated
   by two grasses (Lolium rigidum and Vulpia bromoides) and a legume
   (Trifolium subterraneum). Fits of population dynamic models to per
   capita rates of population change indicate that interactions between the
   grasses were generally strong, while interactions between the grasses
   and legumes were weaker. Most, but not all, of the net effects of
   competition on population growth could be attributed to interactions
   occurring during plant growth. Phase-plane analysis indicated that, for
   a constant environment, a joint equilibrium of the two grasses is
   unstable since interspecific competition between Lolium and Vulpia is
   stronger than intraspecific competition. Consequently: the community
   will tend to a mixture of only one or other of the grass species and T.
   subterraneum, depending on the founding composition of the pasture.
   Analysis of data taken from a year in which a drought occurred
   (1993-1994) demonstrated profound effects on all three species.
   Modelling of the long-term impacts of the effects of repeated droughts
   showed that disturbance of this form overrides the founder effect
   observed under constant conditions. Consequently, Vulpia is ultimately
   able to invade any mixture of the other species in Environments where
   stochastic disturbances occur.}},

Abstract = {{Giant cutgrass {[}Zizaniopsis miliacea], a tall emergent grass native to
   the southeastern United States, was studied in two Florida lakes. In
   Lake Seminole (15176 ha) giant cutgrass forms large expanding stands,
   but in Lake Alice (9 ha) it IS confined to a stable narrow fringe. By
   monitoring individual plants in Lake Seminole, it was found that an
   average decumbent flowering stem produced three flowers and ten nodes,
   80\% of which became rooted in the substrate. Such flowering stem
   development could potentially result in stand expansion of 2.2-2.7 m/yr,
   depending upon water levels and rates of node rooting. Once flowering
   stems became decumbent in Lake Alice, they typically broke, producing no
   more than two flowers with four nodes in a growing season. While still
   attached to the parent plant, few of these nodes were able to become
   rooted in the substrate, limiting the rate of stand expansion in Lake
   Alice. Sections of flowering stems bearing axillary shoots that were
   detached from the parent plant and free-floating could become rooted on
   reaching shallow water and produce robust, new, flowering plants. This
   interesting mode of population dispersal and spread has important
   implications for the distribution and management of giant cutgrass.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of the insecticide lambda-cyhalothrin (Karate) on non-target
   arthropods in winter wheat were studied throughout two successive
   seasons in 1998 and 1999. The study particularly focussed on the crop in
   the growing season after insecticide application (also winter wheat) for
   detection of potential long-term effects and for determination of the
   suitability of different sampling methods.
   The investigations were based on the assumption that arthropod
   immigration from surrounding areas is limited in large fields. For this
   reason a simple approach seemed to be feasible. Two plots of equal size
   (10 ha, adjusted to each other) were defined in a 100ha field and
   designated control and treatment plots. Ten sampling points were
   established on each plot. The following monitoring methods were
   utilised: visual counting, sweep netting and pitfall trapping. In the
   first year of investigation, countings and catches were carried out 2
   days prior to insecticide application and 2, 16, 30 and 44 days after
   application. In the next year, they were carried out 365 days and 384
   days after insecticide application in the successive crop of winter
   wheat.
   At the time of the first sampling prior to insecticide application, the
   two plots showed significant differences with respect to arthropod
   density or activity, particularly in visual counting and to a minor
   degree to sweep netting and pitfall trapping. Lower densities or
   activities were observed in the plot reserved for treatment. Measures
   for mathematical equalisation of the results of population densities
   before pesticide treatment should be considered.
   After insecticide application, the densities or activities of non-target
   arthropods decreased, particularly in visual counting and sweep netting.
   After one year, these effects disappeared to a large extent. Several
   groups of arthropods reached even higher levels in the treated plot than
   in the untreated one. The pitfall traps revealed weak
   activity-decreasing effects in carabids and spiders in the treated plot,
   but the opposite tendency for staphylinids. Hence, it seems that the
   conditions in a large field are less homogeneous, and that smaller scale
   conditions can support processes of recovery in non-target populations.}},

   minimising the impact of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations}},

Abstract = {{The impact of escaped farmed salmon on wild populations may have
   potentially negative genetic and ecological effects. There is widespread
   evidence that farmed salmon interact with wild salmon. The use of
   sterile fish in culture has been proposed as a means of eliminating
   genetic interaction and minimising the ecological effect of farmed
   salmon. In this study, the migration behaviour of groups of triploid
   salmon were investigated through the controlled release of microtagged
   triploid and diploid stocks on the western coast of ireland. Mixed-sex
   and all-female stocks of ranched grilse origin were triploidised using
   hydrostatic pressure. Smolts were ranched from the hatchery of origin
   and two groups of post-smolts were released from cages in a marine site.
   The return of adult salmon from these experimental release groups to
   coastal and freshwater capture sites was monitored as part of the Irish
   national coded wire tag recovery programme. The return of triploid
   salmon from each of the release groups, both to the coast and to fresh
   water, was significantly reduced compared to diploid salmon. The highest
   percentage return to fresh water (2.25\%) was in the ranched mixed-sex
   diploid group. In contrast, no salmon from the cage release groups
   returned to the hatchery location on the Burrishoole river system and
   recoveries in other freshwater systems were low (< 0.01\%). The return
   of a small number of hormonally deficient, sterile triploid female fish
   suggests that migration to fresh water is not inextricably linked with
   reproduction. The substantially reduced return of hormonally competent
   triploid males to the coast and to fresh water, indicates that other
   factors may have an effect on their marine survival. The reduced return
   of triploid salmon to the coast and to fresh water, together with their
   inability to produce viable offspring, demonstrates the potential for
   triploidy as a means of eliminating genetic interactions between
   cultured and wild populations? and of reducing the ecological impact of
   escaped farmed fish. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Gloeotrichia echinulata (J. E. SMITH) RICHTER from lake sediments and

   of planktonic populations, whereas uptake from epilimnetic water by
   vegetative colonies is insignificant. During the spring and summer of
   1996, the cellular phosphorus quota of both benthic and epilimnetic
   Gloeotrichia colonies was monitored in the oligotrophic Peninsula Lake,
   central Ontario, Canada, in order to detect signs of luxury uptake and
   subsequent utilisation during growth. Assays were also used to measure
   the rate of phosphorus uptake from the sediment and from lake water. G.
   echinulata, which overwinters in the form of the benthic akinete

   following germination in early summer, and subsequent growth in the

Abstract = {{Euphorbia barnardii, Dyer \& Sloane is a relatively small, succulent
   shrub found in the Northern Province of South Africa. In 1994 it was
   listed as endangered by the Transvaal Threatened Plants Programme,
   because only three populations, totalling 1150 plants, were found.
   However, our study found five populations totalling 10 783 plants (9503
   were reproductive). One population, found 50 km from the others, in the
   Bewaarkloof district, differs in terms of habitat type and morphology
   and may therefore be a different taxon. The other populations occur in
   Sekhukhuneland, Soil analyses showed that E. barnardii is restricted to
   ultramafic (serpentine) substrates. A sample of 2015 plants was examined
   in 1995 for size, stage, new growth, dead branches, reproduction
   (indices of vigour), damage and disease. Analysis of the results of 10
   years' demographic monitoring (1985-1995) on two of the Sekhukhuneland
   populations showed that one population, which was vigorous in 1995,
   showed little change in population size and structure, while the other,
   which had low vigour in 1995, showed a precipitous decline to local
   extinction in the monitoring plot. Aerial photographs taken in 1957
   (1963 for Bewaarkloof) and 1986 showed large increases in human
   population density within 1.5 km of the E. barnardii populations except
   at Bewaarkloof, where it decreased. An increase in human habitation is
   associated with an increase in livestock (mostly cattle and goats) which
   trample plants. Trampling damages the terminal segments, which may lead
   to lowered reproductive output and increase susceptibility to
   opportunistic bacterial wilt pathogens. Bacterial wilts were prevalent
   oil all populations but were particularly high at Bewaarkloof and on the
   population that showed a steep decline in numbers. Disease incidence was
   associated with the level of plant damage. The impact on plants further
   up the slopes and on the cost of hills (quite far from human
   settlements) was to a far lesser degree but further increases in human
   population density could change this situation. While this study has
   shown that the population size of E. barnardii is much greater than
   previously thought, the species is still threatened by several different
   processes and should be listed as `Vulnerable (Ala + c, B1, B2b + e, C1,
   D2)' according to World Conservation Union categories.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the impact of red fox (Vulpes vulpes Linnaeus 1758)
   predation on juvenile eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus Shaw
   1790) using a replicated predator removal experiment. In two sites in
   Namadgi National Park, south-eastern Australia, a persistent 1080
   poisoning campaign over 18 months reduced fox density by more than 85\%,
   and to less than 10\% of the fox density in two other sites with no fox
   baiting. Changes in the mother:young ratios and densities of kangaroo
   populations were monitored twice monthly along 2-km transects in each
   site from July 1993 to February 1995. Compared to nonremoval sites,
   where foxes were controlled, 25-40\% more females retained juveniles
   over the period when these young became emergent from the pouch. This
   higher survival of emergent pouch young resulted in a significantly
   higher proportion of juveniles in kangaroo populations at fox control
   sites, which resulted in a significantly higher annual growth rate. We
   conclude that predation upon juveniles is an important limiting factor

Abstract = {{Autumn densities of the pest weevil Sitona discoideus and its braconid
   parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides were monitored from 1996 to 1998 on
   the Canterbury Plains New Zealand. M. aethiopoides was introduced as a
   biological control agent in 1982 and first appeared in the study area in
   1986. By 1991 around 50\% of autumn weevils were parasitized and weevil
   density had been reduced by 75\%. A model for the system at that time
   suggested that this level of suppression would be sustained. In
   agreement with the model, the recent survey confirmed that successful
   biological control had been maintained, with 75\% suppression of weevil
   density but slightly lower rates of parasitism of around 35\%. Weevil
   densities showed a significant trend longitudinally across the area
   surveyed, increasing from east to west, probably reflecting soil type.
   Weevil sex ratio was significantly biased towards females, yet the
   proportion of males that were parasitized was twice that of females. Per
   cent parasitism in autumn related positively to weevil density over time
   and space. The scale of homogeneity and by implication effective annual
   dispersal, is estimated at 12 +/- 4 km radius for weevils.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of released exotic mango mealybug
   parasitoid Gyranusoidea tebygi on mango mealybug Rastrococcus invadens
   in Nigeria. Observations were also made on the occurrence of the
   mealybug on other host plants in the surveyed areas. The monitoring
   exercise started in 1991 about 2 years after the first release in
   Ibadan. By 1997 and 1998, G. tebygi was found to have crossed all
   agro-ecological barriers to colonize the entire area of infestation
   nationwide oil mango as well as other host plants. During this period,
   the populations of R. invadens had gleatly decreased from between 11.0
   and 98.0 mealybugs pel leaf in 1991 to between 0.0 and 18.2 mealybugs
   per leaf in 1998. This fall was attributed to the activities of the
   released parasitoid. At many sampling sites in 1998, mealybugs were
   virtually absent on both mango and other host plants Predators that were
   observed during the survey, were the coccinellids. Exochomus promptus
   Weise, Chilocorus nigritus (F) and Nephus spp. Larvae of chrysopid
   species, Ceratochrysa autica (Walker) and Plesiochrysa sp. The

Abstract = {{The endangered Gould's petrel (Pterodroma leucoptera leucoptera) nests,
   almost exclusively, in rainforest on Cabbage Tree Island, New South
   Wales, Australia. Since their introduction in 1906, European rabbits
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have greatly changed the structure of the
   rainforest, threatening its existence and that of the petreI. Rabbits
   were eradicated by sequential epizootics of myxomatosis and rabbit
   haemorrhagic disease (RHD), and a single application of cereal-based
   bait (Talon(R) 20P) containing the anticoagulant brodifacoum. The
   effectiveness of these mortality agents was evaluated by monitoring 70
   telemetered rabbits, half of which were vaccinated against RHD. A
   natural epizootic of myxomatosis from May to July 1997 reduced the
   rabbit population from about 250 to 100. RHD, released in August 1997,
   reduced the population by a further 55\%, the rabbits dying within 4-23
   days. No survivors tested positive to RHD antibodies. Aerial baiting in
   September 1997 eradicated all remaining rabbits within 13 days.
   Intensive monitoring over the next 6 months detected no survivors.
   Non-target deaths included two buff-banded rails (Gallirallus
   philippensis) and one pied currawong (Strepera graculina). (C) 2000

Abstract = {{We assessed the impact of forest fire on the nesting success of the
   endemic Red-knobbed Hornbill Aceros cassidix in north Sulawesi,
   Indonesia. Pre- and post-fire breeding activity was monitored at 60 nest
   trees. Low rainfall and possible reductions in fruit abundance did not
   appear to have an effect on initial nest uptake or on subsequent chick
   production at non-burnt nests, which were comparable to previous years.
   However, there was an adverse effect on productivity at nests that
   directly experienced fire and the accompanying heat and smoke in the
   vicinity, resulting in a post-fire nest success (62\%) that was
   significantly lower than in previous years (78.6-80\%). Population
   recruitment dropped by an estimated 47\% to 0.17 fledglings/breeding
   pair. Our data suggest that, given the reproductive profile of this
   species and the ability of fire to reinforce its own negative effects on
   forest habitats, Red-knobbed Hornbill populations may be vulnerable to
   the potential effects of repeated fires.}},

Journal = {{BIRD CONSERVATION INTERNATIONAL}},

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{137-148}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{As an island endemic, the Island Scrub-Jay's Aphelocoma insularis
   population status and conservation are of concern. In addition, because
   the Island Scrub-Jay is easily observed, it is an ideal candidate for
   monitoring the effects of management efforts on Santa Cruz Island,
   California. We used estimates of territory size in several different
   habitats occupied by the Island Scrub-Jay and the total area of these
   habitats on the island to develop an empirical estimate of the
   population size for this species. Our most conservative, and we feel
   most realistic, estimate for the Island Scrub-Jay breeding population is
   7,000 individuals and for the non-breeding population 5,500 individuals,
   yielding a total population estimate of 12,500. Even though
   conservative, this estimate is larger than earlier estimates of 4,000 to
   6,000 individuals. Even so, our data suggest no reason exists for
   immediate concern regarding the population viability of the Island
   Scrub-Jay and they provide a baseline for future estimates and
   comparisons. Most importantly, this population estimate can be used to
   monitor the influence on the Island Scrub-Jay of future island
   management efforts, especially regarding exotic tree species and feral
   pigs.}},

Abstract = {{A demographic study was conducted on field populations of Lupinus
   arcticus S. Wats. growing in the understory of a white spruce dominated
   forest, near Kluane Lake, Yukon. The relative effects of soil fertility
   level, neighbours, and herbivory were assessed using a factorial
   experiment of +/- fertilizer (N-P-K), +/- neighbour removal, and +/-
   clipping. We monitored the dynamics of leaves and collected data on
   reproduction, survival, and size for two growing seasons. Fertilizing
   increased the incidence of disease on leaves and reduced reproductive
   efficiency. Clipping reduced leaf cohort survivorship, total leaf
   density, and the incidence of disease on leaves. Removing neighbours
   increased the percent cover of L. arcticus and decreased total leaf
   mortality. Treatments had no effect on the survival of leaves in early
   cohorts. Although there were some significant responses to treatments,
   the overall tendency was a lack of response, especially pertaining to
   leaf population dynamics. This low response to the treatments imposed is
   consistent with the argument that plants growing in low productivity,
   infrequently disturbed habitats should show little response to
   short-term changes in local environmental conditions. The results are
   also consistent with suggestions that plants in moderately stressed
   habitats should be more adapted to withstand grazing than competition.}},

   of Pythium, spp. in recirculating nutrient solutions at two commercial
   greenhouses and to evaluate the ability of 11 chemical and biological
   agents to control root rot of lettuce caused by Pythium aphanidermatum
   under conditions similar to those of commercial greenhouses. The reverse
   dot blot technique was used for identification of Pythium spp. isolated
   from lettuce roots and the nutrient solutions. The population of P.
   aphanidermatum in nutrient storage tanks at both locations were fairly
   consistent ranging from 1 x 10(3) to 13 x 10(3) colony-forming units
   (CFU)/100 L from March 11 to July 21, 1998. Treatment with Boost (strain
   BACT-O of Bacillus subtilis) at 1 x 10(9) and 1 x 10(11) CFU/L, Promo (a
   nutrient supplement) at 1 mL/L. and Agrol (Amway) at 0.02 mL/L
   significantly increased dry lettuce and root weights and reduced the
   disease ratings compared with the control. These results suggest that
   the applications of Boost at 1 x 10(9) CFU/L. Promo at 1 mL/L, and Agrol
   at 0.02 mL/L of nutrient solution have the ability to increase lettuce
   production in the presence of P. aphanidermatum in recirculating

Abstract = {{Koalas are the only living member of their family and therefore deserve
   serious conservation consideration. Koalas have low levels of genetic
   variation within and among populations in the southern part of their
   range, where they have experienced many relocations and population
   crashes since European colonization of Australia. The importance of this
   change in variation is underlined by preliminary indications that levels
   of genetic variation may affect fitness in koalas. Techniques have been
   developed to help identify and monitor genetic problems in koalas and to
   provide the information and tools to make genetic management an integral
   part of koala conservation. The koala is currently at an appropriate
   point for conservation intervention: there is clear evidence of decline
   in some populations, but the existence of other robust populations
   offers the possibility of a variety of creative solutions to their
   conservation problems. Managers should aim to maintain this species'
   current ecological amplitude (the range of environments in which
   populations are found) and minimize the loss, fragmentation, or decline
   of populations. There are no data to suggest that any population
   requires genetic supplementation. The concepts of evolutionarily
   significant unit (ESU) and management unit (MU) can be useful in the
   genetic management of koalas, including monitoring and management
   regimes. But ESUs and MUs can also be misleading if they are not
   interpreted carefully in terms of population history and the ultimate
   goal of management. Translocations should not involve extensive use of
   stock from a single source, especially those with low grade variations,
   and they require careful management to avoid possible problems when
   individuals encounter novel strains of the pathogen Chlamydia pecorum,
   because several genetically distinct strains have been found in koalas,
   some of which may derive from introduced species. Genetic indicators can
   and must make considerable contributions to koala management, but they
   require careful interpretation.}},

Abstract = {{A critical issue affecting the long-term management of koalas is their
   perceived conservation status. Koalas still occur in many areas
   throughout their historical range, but numbers of animals are estimated
   to vary from <100,000 to at least one order of magnitude higher. Complex
   factors limit free-ranging koala populations, including food tree
   preferences, history of disturbance, and Chlamydia infection, all of
   which make longer-term population trends of many populations difficult
   to predict. Lack of consensus regarding the size and viability of
   remaining populations and regarding the extent of and reasons for
   decline, or overabundance in some instances, hinders the conservation
   task. A reappraisal of population trends suggests that, notwithstanding
   localized management issues in Victoria and South Australia, overall the
   species is ``vulnerable{''} on the basis of current World Conservation
   Union criteria. Recommendations for more effective conservation of
   koalas include (1) acknowledging the legitimacy of differing
   perspectives, (2) recognizing the uncertainty and assumptions inherent
   in population estimates and trends, (3) applying greater rigor and
   developing better standards for monitoring population trends, and (4)
   being cautious in assigning conservation status to national, state, and
   regional populations.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions can have severe direct and indirect impacts on
   natural communities and are one of the leading reasons behind the loss
   of biodiversity. We investigated the indirect effects of Argentine ant
   (Linepithema humile) invasions on coastal horned lizards (Phrynosoma
   coronatum) through an examination of prey selection in the field and
   laboratory. In non-invaded areas, coastal horned lizard diet consists
   predominately of ants (>94\% by prey item in three reserves examined),
   particularly harvester ants in the genera Pogonomyrmex and Messor. In
   invaded areas, most native ants were displaced, and remaining horned
   lizards incorporated more non-ant arthropods and smaller ants into their
   diet. Tn addition, Argentine ants were never detected in horned lizard
   fecal pellets, suggesting that they are not a suitable replacement food
   source for the native species they are displacing. Analysis of prey
   selection in uninvaded areas reveals that ant species consumption by
   adult lizards is correlated with ant body size rather than ant
   abundance, foraging behavior, or defensive method. Differences in diet
   between adult and juvenile lizards suggest that a diversity of ant
   species is necessary to support both age classes. Laboratory
   experiments, consisting of paired presentations of four native ant
   species and the Argentine ant, confirmed patterns found in the field.
   Both adult and juvenile horned lizards preferred native ants to
   Argentine ants. Patterns of preference suggest that, in addition to L.
   humile's small size, other factors may contribute to the horned lizard's
   aversion to this species.
   Populations of coastal horned lizards have undergone severe declines in
   recent years. While habitat loss has been the primary concern, the
   invasion of Argentine ants into their remaining suitable habitat needs
   to be monitored. Reserves need to be managed to prevent the penetration
   of Argentine ants in order to minimize their direct and indirect effects
   on natural communities.}},

Abstract = {{The bridled nailtail wallaby Onychogalea fraenata is a critically
   endangered marsupial, now restricted to a single locality in central
   Queensland, eastern Australia. Its small size and its nocturnal,
   solitary, and cryptic behavior present problems for monitoring of
   population dynamics. The population apparently declined during a major
   drought between 1991 and 1995, when juvenile survival was low. We
   carried out a detailed demographic analysis from 1994 to 1997 in order
   to estimate survival and abundance in two different habitats, using
   mark-recapture, mark-resight, radio-tagging, and line-transect methods.
   The finite rate of increase (lambda) and its sensitivity to changes in
   survival and reproduction of each age class were also calculated using a
   matrix population projection model. We then assessed biases and the
   value of each method for management. For data other than those based on
   radio-tagging data, population size and survival estimates were
   negatively biased and had large confidence limits. Line-transect
   estimates were likely to be the least biased. The reasons were that
   probabilities of capture and sighting Varied among sexes, sites, and
   times; habitat use varied according to vegetation conditions; and the
   populations were small. Despite this, all methods indicated an
   increasing population size. The projected value of lambda based on
   radio-tagging data was most sensitive to adult survival. Vegetation
   conditions improved throughout the study after an initial drought, and
   the mean projected intrinsic rate of increase was 28\% per year. We
   conclude that management should aim to increase adult survival via
   predator control and that line-transect estimation is the most
   appropriate long-term monitoring method.}},

Abstract = {{Describing habitat use by stream fishes is important from both basic
   ecological and fisheries management points of view. The most widely used
   methods of measuring habitat use vary in degree of effort required,
   level of intrusiveness and in the level of spatial and temporal
   resolution. In this paper, we describe a remote monitoring technique
   that can provide detailed and continuous data on habitat use of
   individual fish in the field. The technique is based on the passive
   integrated transponder (PIT) system, in which a newly developed flat-bed
   antenna is placed on the stream bottom and simply requires a PIT-tagged
   fish to swim over it. We present data obtained from work using this new
   technology on brown trout (Salmo trutta) in stream enclosures, in which
   we describe habitat use and temporal patterns of movement by individuals
   and relate such data to growth rate and sex of the individual fish as
   well as to pool depth and time of day. In addition, we describe the
   range of applications of the flat-bed PIT-antenna as well as the
   advantages and disadvantages of using the system.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of catch-and-release fishing upon the Ponoi
   River's Atlantic salmon populations. The Ponoi River is located on the
   Kola Peninsula of the Russian Federation, and has recently been
   developed for sports fishing. Angler exploitation rates are estimated to
   range from 10.4\% to 19\% of the river's salmon, thus the possibility of
   significant levels of post-release mortality is of concern. We
   radio-tracked fish caught and released by anglers in 1995 and 1996.
   Despite our simple equipment and the large size of the river, we were
   able to relocate most fish. These fish had high rates of survival, and
   anglers recaptured about 11\% of them per year a second time. This is
   very similar to the recapture rates observed for Floy-tagged fish
   released in an angler-based mark-recapture assessment. We also held 62
   angled fish for 24 hours in a live cage to evaluate rates of delayed
   mortality. Only one of the 62 fish died, and it was heavily scarred with
   gillnet marks. Most fish that are fatally stressed by angling die within
   24 h (e.g., Booth et al. 1995). In 1996, up to 10\% of our Floy-tagged
   fish were angled and released twice, and about 0.5\% were angled and
   released three times. No significant biases were detected in the
   post-angling movement patterns of these fish. The multiple captures and
   lack of movement bias suggest that fish behavior was little altered by
   the angling experience. Nine fish Floy tagged prior to spawning have
   been recovered as typical emaciated kelts. Three were killed, and a post
   mortem exam showed all had spawned. Parr numbers at all monitored sites
   have been steadily increasing since the advent of catch-and-releasing
   fishing. By contrast, parr growth rates are generally unchanged or
   significantly better.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the blood concentrations of organochlorines (OCs) and
   the diet of glaucous gulls Larus hyperboreus breeding in two
   neighbouring areas at Bear Island in the Barents Sea, north-eastern
   Atlantic. One area was situated on the edge of the large seabird cliff,
   about 100-150 m above sea level. The second area was about 1-2 km from
   the seabird cliff, and 10-50 m above sea level. In both 1997 and 1998
   there were significant differences between the breeding areas for five
   OCs (HCB, HCH, Oxychlordan, DDE and PCB) measured, with the birds
   breeding on the cliff having higher levels. These differences were
   accompanied by a difference in diet between the areas. Birds in the
   former area had at least four times higher intake of guillemot Uria spp.
   eggs, while the birds near sea level seemed to have a much higher intake
   of fish. This study demonstrates the importance of feeding ecology for
   the distribution of OCs within populations. The results have important
   implications for the establishment of monitoring programs for OC
   contamination of the glaucous gull in the Arctic.}},

Abstract = {{The European pine sawfly, Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy) (Hymenoptera:
   Diprionidae), is a widespread and economically important forest insect.
   The sex pheromone communication system of this species has been
   previously investigated in North America, Japan and Europe, with the
   acetate or propionate of the alcohol
   (2S,3S,7S)-3,7-dimethyl-2-pentadecanol (diprionol) shown to be the main
   pheromone component. In some locations, male attraction either increased
   or decreased by the addition of the (2S,3R,7R)-diprionyl acetate isomer.
   However, these studies were made with different batches of synthetic
   pheromones, with different types of traps and according to different
   procedures, so the observed differences might not reflect true
   geographic variation. Here we investigate the geographic pattern of male
   sawfly response by using identical chemicals, traps and experimental
   procedures at eight field sites ranging from Japan in the east to Canada
   in the west. We found an increased inhibitory effect of the
   (2S,3R,7R)-isomer from Japan and Siberia to Europe. At the eastern
   sites, increasing amounts of the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer up to and equal to
   the amount of the (2S,3S,7S )-isomer, did not influence the trap catch,
   whereas at sites in Europe, as little as 1\% of the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer
   almost completely inhibited the attraction. The response of the North
   American population was intermediate. The only site in which the
   (2S,3R,7R)-isomer was essential for the attraction of males was in
   Siberia. A similar pattern was found for the (2S,3R,7S)-isomer. Both the
   acetate and the propionate form of the (2S,3S,7S)-isomer were attractive
   by themselves in Japan, Europe and North America, and neither the
   (2S,3R,7S)-isomer nor the (2S,3R,7R)-isomer alone were attractive, in
   the acetate or propionate form. We discuss the significance of our
   findings for the development of more efficient monitoring schemes and
   for the causes of population divergence and speciation in the European
   pine sawfly.}},

Abstract = {{Patagonia was one of the last regions in the Americas to be settled by
   Europeans. It was not until the mid-1880s that the Argentine government
   secured effective control over the region, after which settlement and
   economic development were based on sheep ranching. Virtually free of
   domesticated animals in 1885, by 1910 Patagonian rangelands supported
   some 12 million sheep. This growth was sustained until 1952, when the
   sheep population of the region peaked at approximately 22 million, but
   the number of sheep in Patagonia has since declined to about 13 million.
   Numerous factors have been implicated in the collapse of sheep ranching,
   one of great significance being the very poor state of Patagonian
   rangelands. Soil erosion is widespread, and the flora has been so
   heavily modified that it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to
   determine what the composition and characteristics of Patagonia's
   pre-European vegetation were. This paper reviews the evolution of
   Patagonia's sheep industry and the nature and extent of environmental
   degradation caused by livestock. Although researchers have long called
   for a response to the environmental and socio-economic dimensions of the
   crisis, only in the past decade have initiatives to assess, monitor, and
   reverse degradation in Patagonia been launched. These initiatives often
   promote the diversification of land-use and alternative production
   strategies. Case study evidence from the upper Percey River watershed in
   western Chubut province indicates that ranchers may view alternative
   livelihoods with suspicion. It is suggested that measures to restore and
   protect Patagonian ecosystems would gain greater acceptance if local
   producers were seen as equals in the conservation and development
   process. This could be achieved by replacing more-traditional top-down
   models of policy design and implementation with measures based on
   genuine consultation and participatory, community-based approaches to
   natural resource management.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of Callirhytis cornigera (Osten Sacken) and its associated
   community of natural enemies and inquilines were monitored on pin oak,
   Quercus palustris Muenchhausen, in Lexington, KY, from 1997 to 1999. The
   gall wasp has alternating agamic and sexual generations that differ
   morphologically and develop in multichambered galls on branches and
   single-chambered galls on leaves, respectively. There was a strong
   association between maximum gall diameter and the number of total stem
   gall inhabitants, such that proportionately more C. cornigera survived
   and fewer were parasitized as stem gall diameter increased. The most
   abundant natural enemies of the agamic generation included the
   hymenopteran parasitoids Syncophila spp. (Eurytomidae) and Ormyrus
   labotus Walker (Ormyridae), and the clerid predator Phyllobaenus
   verticalis (Say). The most abundant inquilines in stem galls were the
   cynipids Synergus sp. near lignicola and Ceroptres sp., and the dogwood
   borer, Synanthedon scitula (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae). In leaf
   galls, Aprostocetus sp. was the most abundant parasitoid, and Ceroptres
   sp. was the only inquiline. The unique aspects of the C. cornigera gall
   system are discussed, including the relative abundance, emergence
   phenology, and host relationships of C. cornigera and its associated
   natural enemies and inquilines.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating populations of both pest and natural enemy species is
   important in the planning and implementation of biological control. For
   example, synthetic pheromone lures are used to sample bark beetles, and
   sometimes their predators, in forest ecosystems. However, insect
   attraction to natural pheromone sources may differ from attraction to
   synthetic pheromone lures. Moreover, these differences may vary
   systematically between the target pest and some important natural
   enemies. Thus, the accuracy of both absolute and relative abundances of
   bark beetles and predators could vary with lure selection. We evaluated
   a series of synthetic lures to determine which lure gave the closest
   approximation to actual numbers of Ips pini (Say) and. predators
   arriving at hosts infested with I. pini in Wisconsin. We deployed
   synthetic lures containing various ratios of the (+) and (-) enantiomers
   of the principal I. pini pheromone component, ipsdienol, with or without
   an additional component, lanierone. I. pini showed strong preferences
   for specific enantiomeric ratios of ipsdienol, and these responses were
   synergized by lanierone. Predators showed equally strong attraction to
   ipsdienol, but preferred different ratios of the stereoisomers. The
   addition of lanierone had no effect on predators. The most abundant
   predator, Thanasimus dubius (F.), showed greater preference for host
   material infested with I. pini than any synthetic lure. These
   disparities in responses, combined with strong disparities in seasonal
   flight patterns, provided estimates of pest to predator ratios that
   varied by as little as 12\% to as much as 12 times, from pest:predator
   ratios arriving at host material infested with I. pini. These results
   suggest that variation between herbivores and their natural enemies in
   their phenology, preferred pheromone blends, and infested host material
   should be considered when developing estimates of relative pest and
   predator densities for subsequent management options.}},

Abstract = {{We review the factors influencing children's exposure to environmental
   contaminants and the data available to characterize and assess that
   exposure. Children's activity pattern data requirements are demonstrated
   in the context of the algorithms used to estimate exposure by
   inhalation, dermal contact, and ingestion. Currently, data on children's
   exposures and activities are insufficient to adequately assess
   multimedia exposures to environmental contaminants. As a result,
   regulators use a series of default assumptions and exposure factors when
   conducting exposure assessments. Data to reduce uncertainty in the
   assumptions and exposure estimates are needed to ensure chemicals are
   regulated appropriately to protect children's health. To improve the
   database, advancement in the following general areas of research is
   required: identification of appropriate age/developmental benchmarks For
   categorizing children in exposure assessment; development and
   improvement of methods for monitoring children's exposures and
   activities; collection of activity pattern data for children (especially
   young children) required to assess exposure by all routes; collection of
   data on concentrations of environmental contaminants, biomarkers, and
   transfer coefficients that can be used as inputs to aggregate exposure
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Current pesticide health risk assessments in the United States require
   the characterization of aggregate exposure and cumulative risk in the
   setting of food tolerances. Biologic monitoring can aggregate exposures
   from all sources and routes, and can integrate exposures for chemicals
   with a common mechanism of action. Its value was demonstrated in a
   recent study of organophosphorus (OP) pesticide exposure among 109
   children in an agricultural community in Washington State; 91 of the
   children had parents working in agriculture. We estimated individual OP
   pesticide doses from urinary metabolite concentrations with a
   deterministic steady state model, and compared them to toxicologic
   reference values. We evaluated doses by assuming that metabolites were
   attributable entirely to either azinphos-methyl or phosmet, the two OP
   pesticides used most frequently in the region. Creatinine-adjusted
   average dose estimates during the 6- to 8-week spraying season ranged
   from 0 to 36 mu g/kg/day. For children whose parents worked in
   agriculture as either orchard applicators or as fieldworkers, 56\% of
   the doses estimated for the spray season exceeded the U.S. Environmental
   Protection Agency (EPA) chronic dietary reference dose, and 19\%
   exceeded the World Health Organization acceptable daily intake values
   for azinphos-methyl. The corresponding values for children whose parents
   did not work in agriculture were 44 and 22\%, respectively. The
   percentage of children exceeding the relevant reference values for
   phosmet was substantially lower (< 10\%). Single-day dose estimates
   ranged from 0 to 72 mu g/kg/day, and 26\% of these exceeded the EPA
   acute reference dose for azinphos-methyl. We also generated dose
   estimates by adjustment for total daily urine volume, and these
   estimates were consistently higher than the creatinine-adjusted
   estimates. None of the dose estimates exceeded the empirically derived
   no-observable-adverse-effect levels for these compounds. The study took
   place in an agricultural region during a period of active spraying, so
   the dose estimates for this population should not be considered
   representative of exposures in the general population. The findings
   indicate that children living in agricultural regions represent an
   important subpopulation for public health evaluation, and that their
   exposures fall within a range of regulatory concern. They also
   demonstrate that biologically based exposure measures can provide data
   for heath risk evaluations in such populations.}},

Abstract = {{One hundred ninety-five 6- to 7-year-old children who lived in the
   municipality of Siena (Tuscany, Italy) underwent biologic monitoring to
   evaluate urinary excretion of several alkylphosphates that are
   metabolites of organophosphorus pesticides. We evaluated
   dimethylphosphate (DMP), dimethylthiophasphate (DMTP),
   dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP), diethylphosphate (DEP),
   diethylthiophosphate (DETP), and diethyldithiophosphate (DEDTP). We
   obtained urine samples taken in the children's schools, and each sample
   was accompanied by a questionnaire about lifestyle and dietary habits.
   We found DMP and DMTP in detectable concentrations in the greatest
   number of samples (96 and 94\%, respectively). Thr DMP values were
   geometric mean (CM) 116.7, {[}geometric standard deviation (GSD) 2.5],
   and a range of 7.4-1,471.5 nmol/g creatinine. The corresponding DMTP
   values were GM 104.3 (GSD 2.8) and a range of 4.0-1,526.0 nmol/g
   creatinine. DMDTP, DEP, DETP, and DEDTP concentrations were GM 14.1,
   (GSD 3.0), and a range of 3.3-754.6 nmol/g creatinine in 34\% of the
   children; GM 33.2, (CSD 2.4), and a range of 5.1-360.1 nmol/g creatinine
   in 75\% of the children; GM 16.0, (GSD 2.9), and a range of 3.1-284.7 in
   48\% of the children; and GM 7.7, (GSD 2.1), and a range of 2.3-140.1 in
   12\% of the children, respectively. The significant variable for urinary
   excretion of these metabolites in children was pest control operations
   performed inside or outside the house in the preceding month; however,
   the presence of a vegetable garden near the house rarely emerged. The
   urinary excretion of alkylphosphates in children was significantly
   higher than in a group of the adult population resident in the same
   province.}},

Abstract = {{1. Taxonomic issues in many Daphnia species complexes are often confused
   by a high degree of phenotypic plasticity and by interspecific
   hybridisation. Here, we employ molecular genetic tools to confirm the
   species composition and incidence of hybridisation in extant and resting
   egg populations of Daphnia from Windermere and Esthwaite Water in the
   English Lake District.
   2. A combination of species-diagnostic allozymes and mtDNA, confirms
   that contemporary populations are dominated by a single species, D.
   galeata.
   3. We present the first account of genetic characterisation of dated
   `resting' eggs using microsatellites and mtDNA, employing PCR-based DNA
   recovery, thus providing a temporal dimension to taxonomic patterns.
   Thirty years ago, two species were present in Esthwaite, D. galeata and
   D, hyalina, but Windermere populations were dominated by D. galeata
   only.
   4. The use of PCR-based mtDNA RFLP analysis as a species-diagnostic
   tool, and microsatellites to monitor clonal diversity, provide a
   valuable approach for long-term studies, especially in populations free
   from the complicating effect of frequent hybridisation. The detailed
   limnological records available for many large lakes, and associated
   changes in land-use, pollutants and climate, combined with long-term
   ephippial molecular genetic data, provide opportunities for exploring
   natural and anthropogenic impacts on genetic and community structure.}},

Abstract = {{The pine shoot beetle (PSB), Tomicus piniperda is a recently established
   exotic pest of live pine in the southern Great Lakes region of the U.S.
   and Canada. Scotch pine, Pinus sylvestris L. is the most susceptible
   pine species, but the adult also attacks several other North American
   species of Pinus. This research investigated the dispersal behavior of
   beetles emerging from overwintering sites to aid in the development of
   effective monitoring and management practices. Scotch pine logs with
   overwintering PSB were sprayed with fluorescent pigments to mark
   dispersing beetles. These logs were placed in piles in the centers of
   three circular trap arrays of 8-unit Lindgren traps, baited with
   a-pinene, and placed at distances of 50, 100, 200, 300 and 400 meters
   from the center along equally spaced radii. An estimated average of 393
   PSB, or 23.4\% of the overwintering PSB, dispersed from each of three
   log piles during the initial spring dispersal flight, and 21.9\% of
   these were captured in traps. Traps within 100 meters caught 56.0 to
   67.8\% of the marked PSB recovered. Most (95.3\%) marked PSB were
   trapped within 400 meters, but 12 beetles (4.7\%) were trapped 780-2,000
   meters away in adjacent trap arrays. The dispersal pattern of the
   population, as indicated by trap catch, was to the northeast, in the
   direction of prevailing westerly/ southerly winds up to 4.77 m/s daily
   average during beetle flight. Regression analysis suggests that the PSB
   within the experimental area had a predicted dispersal distance of 900
   meters in an area that contained numerous traps. Dispersal distances may
   be greater under of conditions of strong and steady winds or if traps or
   abundant host material removed fewer PSB from the dispersing population.
   The use of traps to monitor specific sites should consider the direction
   of prevailing winds. Trap catches of wild PSB suggest that optimal
   inter-trap spacing for efficient detection could be about 78 m.}},

Abstract = {{Dairy cattle grazing has become popular to dairy farmers in the
   Northeast looking for management schemes to cut production costs.
   Carabidae (ground beetles) and Staphylinidae (rove beetles) are
   indicators of habitat disturbances, such as drainage of wetlands, or
   grassland for grazing animals, and their monitoring could provide one
   measure of ecosystem sustainability if intensive grazing management
   systems expand or intensify in the future. Our objective was to assess
   the abundance and species richness of these two beetle families under
   intensive grazing throughout Pennsylvania, southern New York and
   Vermont. We collected 4365 ground beetles (83 species) and 4,027 rove
   beetles (79 species) by pitfall traps in three years in Pennsylvania.
   Nine ground beetle species, Amara aenea, Poecilus chalcites,
   Pterostichus melanarius, Bembidion quadrimaculatum oppositum, Amara
   familiaris, Poecilus lucublandus, Agonum muelleri, Bembidion obtusum and
   Bembidion mimus represented 80\% of the Carabidae collected.
   Five other species were new to Pennsylvania. Four rove beetle species,
   Philonthus cognatus, Meronera. venustula, Amischa analis, and Philonthus
   various = (carbonarius), comprised 74\% of the total Staphylinidae
   collected. Yearly distributions of the dominant species did not change
   significantly in the three years with A. aenea and P cognatus being most
   abundant every year. A parasitic rove beetle, Aleochara tristis, was
   recovered for the first time in Pennsylvania and Vermont since its
   release in the 1960's to control face fly, Musca autumnalis.
   Similar results were found in New York and Vermont. We collected 1,984
   ground beetles (68 species). Pterostichus melanarius was most abundant.
   Pterostichus vernalis was detected for the first time in the United
   States (Vermont). It was previously reported from Montreal, Canada. We
   collected 843 rove beetles (45 species). Philonthus cognatus was the
   most abundant rove beetle. In addition, Tachinus corticinus, previously
   known only from Canada, was discovered for the first time in the United
   States in Vermont.
   Pastures in Pennsylvania were diverse, containing 14 species of forage
   plants and 17 weed species. Botanical composition was similar in New
   York and Vermont. Sixteen species of grasses and legumes made up 90\% of
   the plant composition and 36 species of weeds made up the remainder.
   This diverse plant ecosystem may explain the richness of ground and rove
   beetles in northeastern U.S. pastures because the heterogeneity in the
   plant population provided additional resources which can support a rich
   assemblage of beetles. Monitoring richness and abundance of Carabidae
   and Staphylinidae over three years in Pennsylvania suggests intensive
   grazing systems are ecologically sustainable.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent changes in population size of butterflies and farmland birds
   across north-west European landscapes have been linked to the effects of
   agricultural intensification. Reduction in food supply has been
   postulated as one of the proximal causes of these trends but the
   generality of this explanation has not been tested at a large scale and
   across animal species.
   2. Changes in abundance of food plants for butterfly larvae and lowland
   farmland birds in the British countryside were analysed for the period
   1978-90 using data from fixed plots recorded as part of the countryside
   surveys of Britain.
   3. Associations were sought between these changes and trends in
   population size of selected butterflies and birds recorded from
   long-term monitoring schemes.
   4. No associations were found between change in abundance of food plants
   and either increasing, stable or decreasing animal groups. At the level
   of individual animal species, significantly more decreases than
   increases in food plant frequency were found for herbivorous bird
   species irrespective of population trend. The size of the reduction in
   food plant frequency was also significantly greater for the declining
   bird group than for stable or increasing groups.
   5. Few significant associations were detected between population trend
   and food plant trend for butterfly species. However, the results
   suggested a positive relationship between increasing butterflies and
   increased abundance of Elytrigia repens and Urtica dioica.
   6. Food plants that increased in abundance comprised species favoured by
   lack of management and increased nutrient availability. Increases in
   abundance were also associated with linear landscape features such as
   hedges and streamsides. Decreasing plant species included arable weeds
   and stress-tolerant species typical of unimproved grasslands.
   7. Based on evidence of local associations between animal and food plant
   change and the need for viable populations of food plants to exist
   within the range of each animal species, we support measures designed to
   enhance and maintain populations of declining food plants. Much evidence
   now exists to identify practical measures that husband food resources
   for many bird and butterfly species. The challenge for conservation
   policy is to manage their implementation at scales necessary to
   influence national trends.}},

Abstract = {{Damage by herbivorous spider mites induces plants to produce volatiles
   that attract predatory mites that consume the spider mites. A clear
   attraction to volatiles from Lima bean plants infested with the spider
   mite Tetranychus urticae has been consistently reported during more than
   15 years for the predatory mite Phytoseiulus persimilis. We have
   monitored the response to volatiles from spider-mite infested Lima bran
   plants for a laboratory population of the predatory mite from 1991 to
   1995 on a regular basis. A reduction in the level of attraction in the
   laboratory population of P. persimilis was recorded in mid-1992. The
   attraction of the laboratory population was weaker than that of a
   commercial population in the latter part of 1992, but the responses of
   these two populations were similarly weak in 1994 and 1995. Therefore, a
   behavioral change has also occurred in this commercial population.
   Experiments were carried out to address the potential causes of this
   change in attraction. The attraction of predators from a commercial
   population with a strong response decreased after being reared in our
   laboratory. Within a predator population with a low degree of
   attraction, strongly responding predators were present and they could be
   isolated on the basis of their behavior: predators that stayed on
   spider-mite infested plants in the rearing set-up had a strong
   attraction, while predators that had dispersed from the rearing set-up
   were not attracted to prey-infested bean plants. From our laboratory
   population with a low degree of attraction, isofemale lines were
   initiated and maintained for more than 20 generations. All isofemale
   lines exhibited a consistently strong attraction to spider mite-induced
   plant volatiles, similar to the attraction recorded for several
   populations in the past 15 years. Neither in a population with a strong
   attraction nor in two with a weak attraction was the response of the
   predators affected by a starvation period of 1-3 hr. Based on these
   results, possible causes for the observed reduction in predator
   attraction to spider mite-induced bran volatiles are discussed. The
   predatory mite P. persimilis is a cornerstone of biological control in
   many crops worldwide. Therefore. the change in foraging behavior
   recorded in this predator may have serious consequences for biological
   control of spider mites.}},

Abstract = {{Interception traps have been used to monitor and sample Colorado potato
   beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say), populations in flight, but the
   efficiency of these traps was unknown. The efficiency of interception
   window traps is limited because flying adults avoid the traps and may
   bounce off the trap without being collected. All trap types tested were
   avoided in night chamber tests, including those constructed of
   transparent Plexiglas or yellow wood boards. A larger screen trap and a
   harp trap designed to reduce detection were also avoided by the beetles
   in night. None of the traps provide a direct estimate of the number of
   adults randomly flying in the trap area. The highest level of efficiency
   for window traps was obtained with the yellow trap, which caught 16\% of
   the expected flying population. Harp and screen traps without frames
   intercepted 60-62\% of the expected flying population. The presence of a
   frame did not increase significantly the avoidance of the screen and
   harp traps by beetles in night. Recommendations are made to maintain or
   increase the efficiency of some traps.}},

Abstract = {{An effective lure-and-kill trap is a potentially important instrument in
   monitoring and controlling oriental fruit flies, Bactrocera dorsalis
   (Hendel). A number of experiments were performed in an orchard of
   commercial guava, Psydium guafava L., to determine how fly captures are
   affected by combining visual and olfactory stimuli, and by the timing of
   trap deployment relative to host phenology. Baiting sticky Ladd traps
   with hydrolyzed liquid protein significantly increased the number of
   captured flies. Mostly male flies were caught in the absence of mature
   guava fruit, whereas mostly female flies were caught when ripe fruit was
   abundant. These results suggest that an effective oriental fruit fly
   trap should include both visual and olfactory lures, and that proper
   timing of trap deployment can be an important factor in monitoring
   female abundance in oriental fruit ny populations.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine the
   efficacy of two Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner formulations, Novodor
   and Raven, for controlling cottonwood leaf beetle, Chrysomela scripta F.
   (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). In laboratory bioassays, larvae or adults
   were added to petri dishes containing Populus X euramericana Guinier
   `Eugenei' foliage that had been created with distilled water (control)
   or one of the commercial Bt formulations at either high or low label
   rates. Survival was recorded on a 24-h basis, and leaf area consumed was
   measured at the conclusion of all trials. Significant differences from
   the control in mortality and leaf area consumption resulted in the
   Novodor and Raven treatments for all life stages tested; however, adults
   were better able to withstand the effects of B. thuringiensis toxins
   than were the immatures. Early- and late instar C. scripta populations
   were monitored in the field (1998 and 1999) after treatment with either
   water or various concentrations of one of the commercial Bt
   formulations. Significant mortality resulted with all concentrations and
   for all life stages tested compared with the control (tap water). The
   commercial formulations also were tested under plantation conditions as
   part of a long-term defoliation study. Both Novodor and Raven reduced
   cottonwood leaf beetle defoliation damage after a single application,
   giving high efficacy for control of cottonwood leaf beetle under the
   conditions and concentrations evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{During an outbreak of the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (L.), in
   California in 1997, nine populations were collected from the major
   broccoli areas throughout the state. Populations were assayed for their
   susceptibility to currently used materials (Bacillus thuringiensis
   subsp. kurstaki, permethrin, and methomyl) and to newer materials that
   had not yet been commercially used in California (spinosad, emamectin
   benzoate, and chlorfenapyr). For the currently used insecticides,
   elevated levels of resistance were seen only with permethrin and seven
   of the nine populations had tolerance ratios (TR) of >100. With the
   newer chemistries, TR values were all <15. To compare potential
   cross-tolerance, TR values of the currently used insecticides were
   compared with TR values of the newer insecticides. There were
   significant relationships found between: methomyl and emamectin
   benzoate, methomyl and spinosad, and permethrin and spinosad. Further
   biochemical studies are needed to confirm the actual mechanisms that
   lead to these relationships and field tests are needed to determine what
   impact, if any, such TR levels would have on control in the field. These
   data indicate that resistance to at least one of the commonly used
   insecticides (permethrin) may have played a role in the outbreak during
   1997. However, other factors may have been at least equally important.
   The winter of 1996-1997 was warmer than normal, and during the period
   from February through August of 1997 the amount of rainfall was <50\% of
   normal. Hot and dry conditions are known to be conducive to outbreaks of
   P. xylostella. These data add to an overall knowledge about the
   geographic variation of resistance in P. xylostella populations within
   the United States. They also serve as a baseline for monitoring changes
   in susceptibility to these newer insecticides and can also help explain
   the occurrence of outbreaks caused by factors other than insecticide
   resistance.}},

   (XenTari), delta endotoxin Cry 1C (MC), and CryIA(c) (MW), and a mixture
   of B. thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki and subsp. aizawai (Agree). Leaf-dip
   bioassays confirmed variation in susceptibility of up to 13-fold for
   MVP, 12-fold for Dipel 2X, sevenfold for XenTari, fivefold for Agree,
   and less than fivefold for MC. Comparisons with previously published
   data indicate that at least the 12-fold variation in Dipel 2X would
   result in significant differences in control in the field. Based on the
   LC99 values observed for the products, we propose discriminating
   concentrations far each product. To ensure continued performance in the
   field we suggest that a resistance monitoring program be implemented to
   detect any changes in susceptibility to B. thuringiensis products and
   specific toxins and that their use be restricted to one generation per
   crop and that they be rotated with other groups of insecticides.
   Furthermore, we suggest enforcement of a crucifer host-free period and
   the development and implementation of cultural and biological control
   strategies to reduce overall population pressure so that fewer
   insecticidal treatments will be needed.}},

Abstract = {{Automated methods of monitoring stored grain for insect pests will
   contribute to early detection and aid in management of pest problems. An
   insect population infesting stored oats ata seed processing plant in
   north-central Florida was studied to test a device for counting insects
   electronically (Electronic Grain Probe Insect Counter, EGPIC), and to
   characterize the storage environment. The device counts insects as they
   fall through an infrared beam. incorporated into a modified grain probe
   (pitfall) trap and transmits the counts to a computer for accumulation
   and storage. Eight traps were inserted into the surface of the grain
   bulk, and the insects trapped were identified and counted manually at
   weekly intervals. Grain temperature and moisture content also were
   recorded for each trap location. Manual and automatic counts were
   compared to estimate error in the EGPIC system. Both over- and
   undercounting occurred, and errors ranged from -79.4 to 82.4\%. The mean
   absolute value of error (+/-SE) was 31.7\% (+/-4.3). At least 31
   species, or higher taxa, were detected, but the psocid Liposcelis
   entomophila (Enderlein) and the foreign grain beetle, Ahasverus advena
   (Waltl), accounted for 88\% of the captured insects. Species diversity,
   phenology, and spatial distribution are presented, as well as temporal
   and spatial distribution of grain temperature and moisture content. The
   data sets generated will find application in population modeling and
   development of integrated pest management systems for stored grain.}},

Abstract = {{Community-level indices of reproductive success are useful for measuring
   or monitoring demographic effects of habitat alteration on birds. We
   present a time-efficient method to estimate the relative reproductive
   activity of the forest songbird community. A recording of mobbing calls
   of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) was broadcast at
   preselected stations during the breeding season. These calls attracted
   individuals of many bird species present in the vicinity, allowing
   visual detection of reproductive activity (e.g., adults carrying food or
   presumed pairs). In mature deciduous forests of northern New Brunswick,
   50 bird species responded to the playbacks. playbacks significantly
   increased the probability of visual observations of birds compared to
   silent observations conducted before broadcasting mobbing calls. In
   coniferous forests of central Quebec, playbacks attracted 24 species and
   also provided a significantly greater opportunity to make visual
   observations of individual birds. In New Brunswick, mobbing playbacks
   facilitated more observations of reproductive evidence relative to point
   counts. Observation periods were brief and a 306-ha plot (1.75 x 1.75
   km, 64 points spaced 250 m apart) could he surveyed by foot in less than
   32 observer-hours. The proportion of individuals of a given species
   showing evidence of reproductive activity was used as an index of
   reproductive success. Black-throated Blue Warblers (Dendroica
   caerulescens) and Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus) had a reproductive
   index consistent with their true nesting success as derived from
   intensive nest monitoring on the same plots.}},

   peaked in abundance November to March, and then declined. Juvenile sprat
   first appeared in September and peaked in abundance in January. Neither
   species was abundant in summer samples. While in the estuary, herring
   and sprat increased in length an average of 4.0 and 0.33 cm
   respectively. Abundance of both species was significantly affected by
   temperature, temporal trend, shoaling behaviour and seasonal variables,
   and of herring by suspended solids, interactions between environmental
   variates did not influence the abundance of either species. As estuarine
   clupeids were influenced by a complex set of events within and outside

Abstract = {{Our study provides new information on walleye spawning behavior in
   impoundment tailwaters. Completion of Harry S Truman Dam (HST) in
   west-central Missouri, USA, in 1977 blocked a major walleye
   (Stizostedion vitreum vitreum) spawning migration and flooded the
   historic upstream spawning area. Creel survey data from 1981-1985, a
   tagging study, and population monitoring suggested problems with walleye
   recruitment. Our objective was to determine if walleye spawning
   movements were affected by fluctuating daily flows from peaking power
   operations. We used ultrasonic transmitters to monitor walleye movements
   intensively for eight weeks during spring 1991. We concluded that
   behavior of walleye in HST tailwaters during spawning season was
   influenced by water releases, possibly affecting spawning success.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive monitoring of the raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV) in

Abstract = {{We monitored the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) nesting population
   of the outer coast of Washington State's Olympic Peninsula during
   1980-98. Peregrine Falcon nesting was concentrated in the central
   portion of the area, where most of Washington's small seabirds nest.
   During our study occupied sites increased from 3 to 24, breeding pairs
   from 2 to 17 and successful pairs from 2 to 13. The mean annual nest
   site failure rate varied between 0-60\%, whereas the mean annual number
   of young per breeding pair varied from 0.8-2.5 young. Successful pairs
   produced an average of 1.5-3.0 young annually increasing significantly
   (P < 0.02) during the study period and approaching that of a
   reproductively healthy stable population at Langara Island, British
   Columbia. This marine peregrine population produced significantly fewer
   young during Fl Nine years. Continued close monitoring of Peregrine
   Falcons is necessary until populations reach their carrying capacity.}},

Abstract = {{Flights of White-throated Hawks (Buteo albigula) were monitored from two
   mountains in central Chile (33 degrees 24'S, 70 degrees 28'W, 33 degrees
   22'S, 70 degrees 21'W) in 1987-88 and 1996-98 and the data were
   augmented with observations from 1990-98 in several areas of Chile. I
   observed 291 hawks migrating in a north to south direction at the two
   mountain tops in October and from south to north in March and April. The
   hawks migrated in concentrated groups at all times of the day. Surveys
   in other areas between 22-41 degrees S latitude resulted in 35
   observations of White-throated Hawks that were migrating from south to
   north during April and from north to south during September and October.
   I observed breeding in native temperate forests between 38-39 degrees S
   latitude in November and in February, and resident hawks in forested
   areas between 33-41 degrees S latitude. My results indicated that
   White-throated Hawks used native austral forests for breeding and
   migrated to the northern Andes in austral winter, probably up to
   Venezuela and Colombia. Destruction of forests in southern Chile and
   Argentina may have serious consequences on this forest-dwelling hawk.
   Therefore, counting hawks along migratory routes could be an efficient
   method for monitoring its population status.}},

Abstract = {{Oyster reef restoration, protection, and construction are important to
   meeting harvest, water quality, and fish habitat goals. However, the
   strategies needed to achieve harvest and conservation goals have often
   been considered to be at odds. We argue that these goals are. in fact,
   compatible and that the same strategies will promote a sustainable
   harvest of the resource, increased filtration of estuarine waters, and
   increased provision of structured habitat for finfish, crabs, and other
   organisms that utilize oyster reefs or receive benefit indirectly from
   them. Creation or designations of unharvested sites (refuge sites) are
   key components of these strategies. Unharvested reefs have the potential
   to provide vertical relief, which is typically destroyed by harvest
   practices, to act as a source of larvae, which potentially increases the
   supply of harvestable oysters, and to protect those individuals most
   likely to have some resistance to disease. Furthermore. proper
   monitoring and design of refuge and restoration efforts are critical to
   providing information needed to improve the success of future
   restoration efforts, and will simultaneously enhance the basic
   information needed to understand the ecology of oysters and their role
   in estuarine and coastal systems.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of degraded oyster reef habitat generally begins with the
   addition of substrate that serves as a reef base and site for oyster
   spat attachment. Remarkably, little is known about how substrate type
   and reef morphology affect the development of oyster populations on
   restored reefs. Three-dimensional, intertidal reefs were constructed
   near Fisherman's Island, Virginia: two reefs in 1995 using surfclam
   (Spisula solidissima) shell and six reefs in 1996 using surfclam shell,
   oyster shell, and stabilized coal ash. We have monitored oyster
   recruitment and growth quarterly at three tidal heights (intertidal,
   mean low water, and subtidal) on each reef type since their construction
   Oyster recruitment in 1995 exceeded that observed in the two subsequent
   years. High initial densities on the 1995 reefs decreased and stabilized
   at a mean of 418 oyster/m(2). Oyster settlement occurred on all reef
   types and tidal heights in 1996; however, postsettlement mortality on
   the surfclam shell and coal ash reefs exceeded that on the oyster shell
   reefs, which remained relatively constant throughout the year (mean =
   935 oysters/m(2)). Field observations suggest that predation accounts
   for most of the observed mortality and that the clam shell and coal ash
   reefs, which have little interstitial space, suffer greater predation.
   Oyster abundance was consistently greatest higher in the intertidal zone
   on all reefs in each year studied. The patterns observed here lead to
   the preliminary conclusion that the provision of spatial refugia (both
   intertidal and interstitial) from predation is an essential feature of
   successful oyster reef restoration in this region. In addition, high
   levels of recruitment can provide a numerical refuge, whereby the
   oysters themselves will provide structure and increase the probability
   of an oyster population establishing successfully on the reef.}},

Abstract = {{Shellfish management and restoration efforts in Rhode Island date back
   to the late 19th century. From the late 1890s to the Second World War
   the Rhode Island Fisheries Commission operated a lobster hatchery in
   Wickford Harbor in response to a perceived decline in lobster catches in
   Narragansett Bay. Berried lobsters were collected, eggs hatched, larvae
   reared, and postlarval fifth stage juveniles were released to the bay.
   The project was discontinued primarily because of costs and a failure to
   demonstrate the efficacy of juvenile seeding in improving lobster
   catches. From the 1930s to the 1980s, there have been several similar
   efforts to establish hatcheries to produce juvenile bivalve mollusks for
   public and private reseeding efforts, but none of these efforts were
   economically sustainable. The longest running efforts to improve
   shellfisheries have been stare programs to relay northern quahogs,
   Mercenaria mercenaria, from dense population assemblages in waters
   closed to shellfishing. Large-scale relays began in the 1950s in
   response to heavy fishing pressure but ended in the 1960s when
   commercial power dredging for shellfish was banned in Narragansett Bay.
   A small-scale state program existing since the late 1970s pays a modest
   fee to supervised shellfishers for hand digging quahogs in closed waters
   and planting them in management areas for depuration and eventual
   harvest. The amounts of shellfish relayed annually has varied widely
   since 1977, ranging between 7 and 322 metric tonnes, with an average of
   98 metric tonnes per year. A new relay program has been underway since
   1997. It involves assessing the shellfish stocks in the closed
   Providence River and hiring dredge boats to relay shellfish into down
   bay management areas. Based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY)
   considerations, annual relays should not exceed 10.3\% of the standing
   crop (or 2721 metric tonnes) in the Providence River. An effort to
   restore lobsters onto monitored artificial reefs is underway using
   settlement funds from a 1989 oil spill in Narragansett Bay. Finally, the
   Rhode Island Public Benefit Aquaculture Project. a joint educational
   effort with commercial fisheries involvement, is involving secondary
   level students in the nursery culture of shellfish (though marina-based
   upwellers) for seeding of public shellfish beds.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence patterns of mosquitoes inhabiting a 0.1-ha experimental

   during the late summer and autumn of 1996. Culex erythrothorax was the
   largest contributor to emerging populations, comprising 94\% of the
   total emerged adults with an average emergence rate of 59
   adults/day/m(2). None of the Culex species exhibited a pattern of
   emergence associated with water depth (range: 5-60 cm). Culex
   quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis did not show a pattern of emergence
   associated with the inflow-outflow gradient; however, Cx. erythrothorax
   emerged in higher numbers along a transect at the middle of the wetland
   than from near the inflow and outflow. Additionally, the number of
   emerged Cx. erythrothorax was positively correlated with the density of
   vegetation below emergence traps. The comparatively large number of
   adults emerging from the middle of the wetland was most likely caused by
   a trade-off between an increasing gradient of resource abundance and a
   decreasing gradient of toxic compounds from the inflow to the outflow of
   the small wetland.}},

Abstract = {{To examine the effects of submergence time, free-space availability and
   larval supply on height-related differences in settlement density of
   Semibalanus cariosus, we monitored the daily settlement density in plots
   where all benthos were removed daily and in natural-community plots,
   which were left undisturbed, at two sites with different tidal heights:
   the centre and the upper limit of S. cariosus zone, during one
   settlement season. Settlement density was higher at the low-tidal site,
   where settler mortality was low, than at the mid-tidal site, where
   settler mortality was high. The between-site differences in settlement
   was determined by larval preference for height and not immersion time.
   The settlement preference for height was masked on days with high larval
   supply since suitable settlement sites in lower height were saturated by
   settlers.}},

Abstract = {{Historical anecdotes and preliminary monitoring since 1990 indicate that
   New Zealand Long-tailed Bats (Chalinolobus tuberculatus,
   Vespertilionidae) are now rare or absent at many sites where formerly
   they were common. Chalinolobus tuberculatus appeared to be common
   throughout New Zealand in the 1800s but by 1900-30 it was becoming
   scarce in many districts. Formal surveys in the South Island since 1990
   either failed to find C. tuberculatus, or recorded bats in low numbers.
   Of eight sites where transect counts were undertaken, bats were recorded
   frequently at two sites (45-66\% of counts; Eglinton and Dart Valleys),
   rarely at four sites (2.4-10.7\% of counts), and were not recorded at
   the remaining two sites despite considerable survey effort. Of 10 sites
   where stationary counts using automatic detector units were used, no C.
   tuberculatus were recorded in three areas (153 nights combined), they
   were found rarely at six sites (2.1-21.0\% of nights; 461 nights
   combined) and were recorded commonly only in the Eglinton Valley (85\%
   of 120 nights). Assertions that C. tuberculatus are `common' and that
   the conservation status is `secure' are questionable and this review
   supports suggestions that the species should be classed as `Vulnerable'.
   Possible causes of decline have been suggested including clearance and
   logging of lowland forests, predation by introduced mammals and owls,
   competition for roost sites by introduced mammals, birds and wasps, and
   human interference and disturbance at roosting sites. However, authors'
   claims have all been speculative and unsubstantiated. There has been no
   research undertaken to quantify these claims, and this is required
   urgently. The results of these preliminary surveys provide a new
   baseline against which future population trends might be compared.
   Increased effort using standardized monitoring techniques, applied at a
   national level, is required to confirm the possible trends and to help
   identify the best sites where conservation managers may attempt to
   restore the population level.}},

Abstract = {{A general study of biogeochemical processes (DYNAPROC cruise, May 1995)
   was conducted at a station in the open northwestern Mediterranean Sea
   where horizontal advection was weak. During this experiment, short-term
   variations of the vertical distribution of cyanobacteria were
   investigated and a possible link with diel vertical migration was
   considered. Consistently, the experimental work was conducted at a time
   scale of a few hours. Cyanobacteria were the most abundant population in
   the pico- and nanoplankton size-class. Their vertical distribution was
   monitored over 36 h with a frequency of 4 h. With such a time
   resolution, they experienced a single grazing event during daytime and,
   at night, they were heavily grazed when the upper layers were occupied
   by organisms migrating from the aphotic zone. The corresponding
   integrated (0-90 m) losses of cyanobacteria during the night amounted to
   534 mg C m(-2). Though daytime grazing is most likely due to
   nanoflagellates and microzooplankton, night-time grazing could
   significantly involve migrant macrozooplankton organisms and sustain a
   periodic export of organic matter. This study stresses the importance of
   the potential export of organic matter as a consequence of the diel
   vertical migration, export that could not be accounted for by
   measurements at longer time scale.}},

Abstract = {{An image analysis system is described to study the process of imbibition
   in white cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.) seeds. The system consists of
   two components: 1) an environmental system where seeds germinate; 2) a
   computer imaging system, composed of a Charged Coupled Device
   (CCD)-imaging sensor, an image frame grabber, a computer and a video
   monitor. The measurement software can determine area, perimeter, width,
   length and eccentricity as descriptors of changes in seed size during
   swelling. The captured images of imbibing seeds allowed estimation of
   timing of `visible germination' occurrence without any subjective
   evaluation. Using the area parameter, the imbibition process can be
   described graphically by a series of curves similar to the triphasic
   pattern of water uptake, with extension and rate depending on the degree
   of seed viability and germination medium conditions. Imbibitional
   osmotic stress, provided by -1.5 MPa mannitol, induced a large delay in
   germination and, upon stress removal, a more uniform radicle emergence.
   The versatility and the sensitivity of the method, together with the
   feasibility to investigate germination rate in individual seeds within a
   population, suggest that image analysis techniques have high potential
   in seed biology studies.}},

Abstract = {{We provide information on nest-site characteristics and nesting success
   of the greater pewee, Contopus pertinax, in the Huachuca Mountains of
   southeastern Arizona. Primary breeding habitats include montane pine-oak
   forests and sycamore or cottonwood riparian forests. Nests (n = 19) were
   found between 14 May and 29 June 1997, and between 31 May and 6 July
   1998. Egg dates for combined years were between 12 May and 15 July;
   successful nests fledged young between 21 June and 17 July. Nest
   predation on greater pewee nests (47.4\%) was the principal cause of
   reproductive failure. No greater pewee nests were parasitized by
   cowbirds, whereas cowbird parasitism ranged between 11\% and 32\% of
   host populations on the same sites. For all species monitored at both
   sites (n = 203) the frequency of cowbird parasitism did not vary between
   years; however nest predation was significantly higher in 1998 than
   1997. While there was no year effect of nest failure among greater
   pewees, during the year of low nest predation frequency (1997) greater
   pewees had significantly higher nest success than other species on the
   same site. Overall, greater pewees fledged a mean of 0.8 +/- 1.0 (SE)
   fledglings per nest, n = 19. Mean nest height was 11.6 +/- 0.8 m in
   mature stage pines (DBH 46.6 +/- 2.6 cm, mean nest tree height 19.7 +/-
   0.9 m). Greater pewees nested in trees that were significantly taller
   than canopy trees found in non-use sites. A combination. of high nest
   placement and aggressive nest defense may account for the lack of brood
   parasitism and low rate of nesting failure caused by predation during
   low predation years.}},

Abstract = {{This study is to evaluate the applicability of estimating the
   one-dimensional horizontal hydraulic diffusivity of an unconfined
   aquifer with time-dependent fluctuation of lateral head and vertical
   recharge boundaries using observed water level spectra. Different models
   of boundary condition are imposed to evaluate the statistical
   significance between the calculated hydraulic diffusivity (xi') with the
   given hydraulic diffusivity (xi). The auto-spectra of the water level in
   observation wells tapping the same aquifer are closely related to those
   at the disturbed boundaries. For an aquifer with a constant hydraulic
   diffusivity, the water level fluctuation in the monitoring wells is
   linearly related to the water level spectra observed at the boundaries.
   The spectral density function of aquifer hydraulic head varies inversely
   with specific yield (S-y) and directly with recharge. Given small
   variation in water level spectra at the disturbed boundaries, the water
   level fluctuation in the aquifer is affected by the recharge condition
   and the aquifer spectral density function is sensitive to S-y. Using an
   iterative technique to estimate xi from 1400 sets of given parameters,
   99\% of the xi'/xi values deviated within only one order of magnitude
   with the model length (L) being equal to 1 km and 10 km. For L equal to
   100 m, approximately 82\% of the xi'/xi population falls within two
   orders of magnitude. Therefore, spectral analysis of aquifer hydraulic
   head response can be used to estimate the hydraulic diffusivity of an
   unconfined aquifer which is affected by periodic variations in recharge
   and head at boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes a consumer's adaptive feeding response to
   environmental gradients. We consider a consumer-resource system where
   resources are distributed among many discrete resource patches, Each
   consumer exhibits a feeding morphology allowing it to remove resources
   from a patch down to some threshold density (or level) before having to
   seek resources elsewhere. Assuming consumers trade off resource
   extraction with patch access and predation, we show that for a given
   environment there often exists a single evolutionarily stable feeding
   threshold and it is an evolutionary attractor. We then investigate how
   the population dynamics of the resource and the consumer change as the
   environment changes. Two cases are considered: (i) all consumers exhibit
   a fixed feeding threshold that is adaptive for an intermediate
   environment; and (ii) the consumer population adapts and adopts the
   evolutionarily stable feeding threshold associated with the current
   environment. In less harsh environments (i.e., environments where
   consumers experience a lower risk of predation, or environments where
   resource patches are more abundant) the adaptive consumer population is
   predicted to evolve so that resources within a patch are depleted to
   lower densities. We show that the change in consumer density due to
   environmental change can be rather different depending on whether or not
   the population can adapt. In some situations we observe that when the
   consumer's environment becomes harsher, the consumer population may
   increase in density before a rapid crash to extinction. This result has
   implications for monitoring and managing a population, (C) 2000 Academic

Title = {{Phosphate and ammonium distribution in a pilot-scale constructed wetland
   with horizontal subsurface flow using shale as a substrate}},

Abstract = {{Phosphate: (P) and ammonium (N) distributions were investigated in a
   pilot-scale constructed wetland system (CWS) with horizontal flow. Shale
   was selected as a substrate, on the basis of its P adsorption capacity
   as well as its suitability for plant growth, investigated in an earlier
   study. The system was set up in a greenhouse, and comprised of four
   tanks with and four tanks without Phragmites australis (common reed).
   Sampling ports were installed along the length of each tank, and at
   three different depths, in order to facilitate three-dimensional
   monitoring of nutrient distribution over the period of study (il
   months).
   In the planted systems, H2PO4--P (ortho-P) and NH4+-N concentrations
   were low (0.5-1.0 g m(-3)) at all depths throughout their length.
   Generally, ortho-P and NH4+-N concentrations decreased exponentially
   along the transect from the tank inlet to the outlet. In the unplanted
   systems, higher values (0.5-16.5 g m(-3)) of ortho-P were observed.
   NH4+-N in the unplanted systems was relatively high (10-30 g m(-3))
   throughout the period of investigation. In both planted and unplanted
   tanks, NO3--N concentrations were very low at the inlets (0.02-0.05 g
   m(-3)), and increased only slightly towards the outlets. Although the
   presence of P. australis had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on P and N
   concentrations at all depths and along the length of the tanks, the
   nutrient distribution followed the same trend as in unplanted tanks.
   The results were consistent with the theoretical removal model which
   predicts an exponential decrease in pollutant concentrations to a
   background value approaching zero along the transect from wetland inlet
   to the outlet. A modification of the model was suggested where a first
   order area-based reduction rate constant k (m d(-1)) would be replaced
   with (k(p) + k(s)), k(p) representing the rate constant for the removal
   by the plants, and k(s) the rate constant for the removal by the
   substrate, and associated microbial populations they support.
   Approximate values for k(p) + k(s) Of 0.084 m d(-1) (P) and 0.065 m
   d(-1) (N) and for k(s) of 0.069 m d(-1) (P) and 0.034 m d(-1) (N) were
   obtained.
   The hydraulic residence time, now characteristics and permeability of
   the shale was investigated by a bromide (Br-) tracer. The tracer
   breakthrough curves showed a similar pattern in all tanks, with about
   66\% of the now occurring through the bottom zone (0.35 m). The actual
   hydraulic residence time (6 days) was slightly higher than the nominal
   one.
   The tracer study also enabled the calculation of the volumetric rate
   constants, k(v) and approximate values of 0.075 d(-1) (P) and 0.060
   d(-1)(N) were obtained for planted and 0.061 d(-1)(P) and 0.020 d(-1)(N)
   for unplanted tanks.
   The results obtained from this pilot scale study, provide a better
   understanding of nutrient distribution and flow patterns that take place
   within CWS, and should enable more rational design parameters to be
   developed that help to optimise future large-scale systems. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{Tremendous effort is expended in counting migrant raptors in North
   America, where over 1,500 count sites exist. The Biological Resources
   Division of the United States Geological Survey is investigating whether
   migration counts can serve to monitor population trends. To that end, we
   investigated the effects of changes in survey duration on power to
   detect trends using various sample sizes, lengths of surveys, and
   sampling frequencies within a season based on raptor migration count
   data collected from 7 sites. As expected, power to detect trends
   increased as sample size (number of years of counts) increased; its
   magnitude depended on level of trend and variation in annual counts.
   Except for cases with extremely low or high power, 5 additional survey
   years increased power 20\%-50\%. Changing survey length affected power,
   but results varied and depended on the migration pattern of species at
   specific sites. Power to detect trends did not change appreciably when
   counts were conducted only during 90 days of peak migration (for all
   species combined). However, when annual counts were based on 30 or 60
   consecutive days of peak migration, we found decreases in power for most
   site-species combinations. Changing the number of days counted during
   the week resulted in variable changes in power. Our results suggest the
   number of count days within weeks necessary for sufficient monitoring
   should be evaluated on a site- and species-specific basis. We determined
   that a coefficient of variation of 30\% or less in annual counts is
   needed to detect a 3\% average annual decrease in counts over 25 years
   with at least 80\% power. This requirement was met at one or more sites
   for 14 of 20 raptor species. Power to detect increasing trends exceeded
   power to detect decreasing trends, which is unfortunate from a
   conservation perspective. Nevertheless, if count data are collected
   consistently, large-scale population trends for some raptor species may
   be monitored effectively using migration counts.}},

   and an alkalinity of 7.4 mg/l, while Furnace Pond has an average pH of
   6.9 and alkalinity of 14.9 mg/l. The pH of both ponds varied seasonally
   and showed diel changes due to the photosynthetic and respiratory
   activity of aquatic organisms. Precipitation events did not change the
   pH of Furnace Pond. Maquan Pond on the other hand, did exhibit changes
   in surface water pH due to specific acidic precipitation events. During
   certain rainstorms, the pH of Maquan surface waters dropped to values as
   low as pH 4. In addition to the transient changes in pH, the
   acid-sensitive pond also exhibited differences in planktonic
   distribution patterns. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean Sea is characterised by a small tidal range (0.3-1 m).
   Despite this, intertidal communities are well established and their
   upper limits often extend above mean high water level. Organisms living
   in the intertidal region and in the supralittoral zone rely on both
   tides and wave action to perform their biological functions. Lack of
   food, desiccation and predation are common stresses in such a harsh
   environment. The present study deals with the vertical distribution of
   two species of intertidal barnacles, Chthamalus montagui Southward and
   Chthamalus stellatus (Poli), which are the main constituents of the
   barnacle belt along Mediterranean rocky shores. Previous work, carried
   out in the Atlantic, showed that where the distribution ranges of the
   two Chthamalus species overlap, C. montagui is more common in the upper
   barnacle zone while C, stellatus is dominant lower down. The main aims
   of our study are: (1) to establish if there is a relationship between
   position and extension of the barnacle belt on the shore and tidal range
   and/or wave exposure, (2) to test the hypothesis that in the study areas
   C. montagui is more abundant than C. stellatus high on the shore, and
   that the pattern is reversed lower down. Barnacle populations were
   monitored in summer 1998 in the Gulf of Genoa (Ligurian Sea) and in the
   Gulf of Trieste (North-Adriatic Sea). The two areas differ in tidal
   range and hydrodynamism, the former presenting quite strong wave action
   and a tidal range of 30 cm, the latter having limited wave action and 1
   m tidal range. Three shores were randomly selected in each gulf and two
   transects on each shore. Counts of barnacles in 10 {*} 10 cm quadrats
   were done at different shore heights along each transect. The data was
   subjected to analysis of variance. Results showed that a more pronounced
   hydrodynamic regime corresponded to a shift of the barnacle belt towards
   the higher shore (Gulf of Genoa), while in more sheltered areas (Gulf of
   Trieste), the barnacle distribution was confined to the intertidal
   region. The relative spatial distribution of C. montagui and C.
   stellatus within the barnacle belt varied locally, even between
   transects on the same shore, and this obscured the distribution pattern
   along the Vertical gradient. Nevertheless, it was still possible to
   conclude that at mid and high shore in Genoa, C. stellatus was more
   abundant than C. montagui, while in Trieste the pattern was reversed.}},

Abstract = {{Recent awareness of amphibian declines has raised the need for effective
   monitoring programs. Call surveys are a standard approach to monitoring
   populations of most anuran species. Temporal variation in calling
   activity, however, may result in failure to detect some species.
   Automated recording systems (ARS) allow consistent sampling for extended
   periods with little or no disturbance to calling anurans. We used an ARS
   to measure temporal variation in anuran calling activity during the
   summer of 1997 at a Carolina bay on the U.S. Department of Energy's
   Savannah River Site, South Carolina. We documented considerable
   interspecific variation in calling activity, a phenomenon that, using
   traditional call survey techniques, would result in failure to detect
   some species. In particular, we found that Southern Leopard Frogs (Rana
   sphenocephala), thought to breed only in early spring and fall in the
   region, called consistently from midnight until dawn during July.
   Because protocols for most call surveys dictate that the listener survey
   only during early evening hours, most call surveys would not detect the
   presence of this species. Our results indicate that temporal variation
   in anuran calling activity warrants further investigation and should be
   considered when developing anuran monitoring programs.}},

Abstract = {{An in-stream removal experiment has been carried out in Red Beck, a
   small stream which receives effluent from Shibden Head Sewage Treatment
   Works. This trickling filter works serves a purely domestic population
   of 9408 but is scheduled to be closed, and the flows diverted to another
   works, as part of Yorkshire Water's continuing capital investment
   programme. An anionic detergent, linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS),
   boron, and standard water quality parameters have been measured at seven
   sites downstream of the effluent discharge point. Time of travel has
   been measured by detection of a fluorescent dye added to the effluent
   sampling chamber, and the increase in flow as the river proceeds through
   the catchment has been determined from current flow measurements, and
   from boron dilution data. Assuming a first order removal mechanism, the
   overall half-life for LAS removal is just over 2 h (2 h 14 min). Faster
   removal takes place in the upper portion of the stream, and removal over
   the last five sampling points is somewhat slower, with a half-life of 2
   h 40 min. This removal may comprise both primary biodegradation and the
   deposition of suspended matter to which the surfactant has been
   adsorbed. There was no significant difference in the removal half-lives
   of the individual alkyl chain length homologues. (C) 2000 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A qualitative modelling approach is used to highlight potential feedback
   mechanisms and secondary effects of management actions on a number of
   key species in a large Argentine wetland. The development of this
   qualitative model, in this case a loop model, was a first step in the
   creation of an overall management and monitoring programme for this
   important wetland. The use of loop models is a possible strategy in
   environmental management and monitoring programmes of large complex
   natural reserves, in which little quantitative data is available. Based
   upon observed ecological information, several loop trophic models were
   constructed and appropriate links made to reflect actual trophic
   relationships between trophic variables. The potential secondary effects
   of a hunting ban on caiman in a large shallow lagoon were examined.
   Indirect secondary effects were found to produce unforeseen negative
   impacts on other predator species (piscivorous birds, piranha) and
   species important to the abiotic environment (large bottom dwelling
   fish). As there are limited quantitative data, field investigations and
   the development of other types of models an necessary to examine in
   detail the quantitative variations on the populations in question. The
   results of this model were found useful to indicate where further study

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the current status of forested, wetland, freshwater
   and coastal ecosystems; the combined impacts of habitat alteration,
   pollution and non-native invasive species on those systems; how climatic
   changes could interact with existing stresses; potential management
   strategies, and crucial research gaps. Changes in climate and climate
   variability would significantly affect natural ecosystems, and may pose
   additional threats to the already-stressed ecosystems of the
   Mid-Atlantic Region (MAR). Fragmentation of the MAR's forests may hinder
   the migration of some species. Urban development and wetland losses
   leave the MAR's rivers and streams and near-shore areas vulnerable to
   damages if the frequency and intensity of storms increase. Inputs of
   sediments, nutrients and toxic chemicals to streams, lakes and estuaries
   might increase if precipitation increases. Accelerated sea-level rise
   could accelerate the loss of coastal wetlands. Estuaries are sensitive
   to changes in temperature, salinity and nutrient loads, and could be
   adversely affected by projected climatic changes. Populations of rare,
   native species could decline, while problems with non-native invasive
   species, such as kudzu and gypsy moths, might increase. The best
   strategies to protect ecosystems from climatic changes may be those that
   reduce other stresses, thus increasing resilience to a variety of
   stresses. Societal priorities for ecosystem protection need to be
   articulated, and research is needed into the values of ecosystems,
   ecosystem functioning, human impacts, long-term ecological monitoring,
   and management options to provide a basis for selecting effective
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of multispecific systems containing both mutualistic and
   antagonistic interacting organisms on the evolution of plant traits have
   seldom been analyzed. We studied the selection exerted by several
   species of herbivores and pollinators in three populations of
   Hormathophylla spinosa (Cruciferae) in the Sierra Nevada (Spain) over 4
   yr by using path analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM). The
   main selective pressures in our study sites were ungulates and
   pollinators. However, the importance of each kind of interacting
   organism differed among populations. Our results indicate a selection
   mosaic among populations of H. spinosa in the Sierra Nevada caused by
   the spatial variation in the relative importance of different
   interactions as selective pressures. We found two main selective
   scenarios, depending on the presence or absence of ungulates. In the
   populations with low ungulate pressure, there was positive phenotypic
   selection in flower number per plant and in flower density (mediated by
   nectarivorous pollinators). In the two populations with high ungulate
   pressure, there was a strong positive, ungulate-mediated selection in
   thorn density. Our results suggest that the application of SEM to
   several populations simultaneously monitored might help to isolate the
   major selection pressures on local populations and identify potential
   differences in selection among populations, becoming a useful
   exploratory approach to study the geographical variation of selection in
   complex systems.}},

Abstract = {{Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a measure of developmental stability, has
   been proposed as a simple technique for identifying populations
   suffering from inbreeding and a loss of genetic diversity. However,
   there is controversy regarding the relationship between FA and both
   allozyme heterozygosity and pedigree inbreeding coefficients (F). FA of
   sternopleural bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster was measured in
   populations maintained at effective sizes of 25 (8 replicates), 50 (6),
   100 (4), 250 (3) and 500 (2) for 50 generations (inbreeding coefficients
   of 0.05-0.71). FA was calculated from the same data set using three
   different indices (FA(1), FA(5) and FA(6)). There was no significant
   relationship of FA with pedigree inbreeding coefficients for any of the
   three indices. The relationship between FA and allozyme heterozygosity
   was non-significant for indices FA(5) and FA(6) (the more powerful
   indices) and only significant for FA(1). A second comparison of highly
   inbred (F approximate to 1) populations with their outbred base
   population showed significantly greater FA in the inbred populations
   only when analysed with FA(6). Analysis of the same data using FA(1) and
   FA(5) showed nonsignificant relationships in the opposite direction. If
   a relationship between FA and genetic diversity does exist, it is weak
   and inconsistent. Consequently, our results do not support the use of FA
   as a monitoring tool to detect inbreeding or loss of genetic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The feeding behavior of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) was
   monitored using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique during
   the transmission process of tomato yellow leaf curl geminivirus (TYLCV).
   The behavior of individual viruliferous whiteflies was recorded on
   two-leaf stage tomato test plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill
   `Riofuego'). A total of 213 whitefly individuals was recorded on single
   test plants during an inoculation access period that ranged from 3.5 to
   14 h. Recordings were classified into 4 categories depending of the
   waveforms observed: group I, including only waveform C (pathway), was
   associated with a residual 2.4\% TYLCV transmission efficiency; group
   II, showing stylet pathway and a single E(pd)(1) waveform, was
   associated with a 7.4\% transmission efficiency; group III, showing
   stylet pathway and a single E(pd)(1) + E(pd)(2) waveform, achieved a
   23.4\% transmission efficiency; and finally group TV, showing pathway
   followed by several E(pd)(1) + E(pd)(2) waveforms, was associated with
   the highest transmission efficiency (37.5\%). A total of 16 different
   behavioral variables was introduced into a stepwise-backward logistic
   regression model to determine the variables most related to TYLCV
   inoculation. Among them, the total duration of E(pd)(1) was the most
   significant variable associated with virus inoculation by B. tabaci (P =
   0.002, positive relationship). In addition, the regression analysis
   indicated a strong positive relationship (P = 0.005) between
   transmission efficiency and total number of E (pd)(1) (t = 4.39, beta =
   0.45 +/- 0.10, r = 0.87), and total duration of waveform E(pd)(1) (P =
   0.05) (t = 4.00, beta = 0.02 +/- 0.001, r = 0.94). The minimum phloem
   contact E(pd)(1) threshold period observed for successful inoculation of
   TYLCV by B. tabaci on tomato plants was 1.8 min. Implications of these
   results for. persistent virus transmission by whiteflies are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Larvae of closely related parasitoid taxa often lack morphological
   differences that can be used for species level identification.
   Determining the parasitoid species present in a host population may
   require rearing, often a time-consuming process. To monitor field
   parasitism rates by several species of Peristenus wasps (Hymenoptera:
   Braconidae) that are natural enemies of Lygus (Heteroptera: Miridae), we
   have developed a two-step molecular approach. Polymer,we chain reaction
   (PCR) of the COI gene with wasp-targeting primers is performed on DNA
   extracted from a Lygus nymph and the parasitoid larva (if any) therein.
   A positive reaction indicates parasitoid presence. A restriction digest
   of the PCR product then indicates which parasitoid species is present
   among known alternatives, and a diagnosis is achieved in days rather
   than weeks or months.}},

Abstract = {{The Chernobyl fallout caused release of radioisotope contaminants in a
   very large area that includes Belarus, the Ukraine, and the Russian
   Federation. In this study, the authors monitored the health status and
   level of internal contamination in 422 children who resided in the
   aforementioned areas and who were less than or equal to 10 gamma of age
   at the time of the accident. The children came to Italy for a 1-mo
   period between 1991 and 1992. During this time, the children underwent
   pediatric checkups and biochemical, immunological, and thyroid analyses.
   All children underwent whole-body counter measurements, and urine
   radiotoxicological analysis was performed for 224 of them. The 24
   children evacuated from Pripiat, a village very close to the Chernobyl
   reactor site, were selected for cytogenetic analysis. All of these
   children continue to have a detectable internal contamination of caesium
   radioisotopes. This condition is likely the result of ground and
   foodstuff contamination in the various areas. The children did not
   evidence overt pathologies related to ionizing radiation. However, minor
   alterations in immunological and thyroid parameters were observed in the
   group of the evacuated children. Traditional cytogenetic dosimetry was
   not possible, but the occurrence of acentric fragments was
   observed-indicating a persistent effect of continuous exposure to low
   doses of radiation.}},

Abstract = {{It is now well established that ecdysteroids can be produced in insects
   in the absence of prothoracic glands, In this respect, it has been shown
   that cells in culture can produce ecdysteroids, Our aims were: (1) to
   determine whether ecdysteroid target cells of epidermal origin could
   also be the source of ecdysteroids; (2) to monitor more accurately the
   kinetics of ecdysteroid production; and (3) to check for possible
   relationships between this synthetic activity and dynamics of cell
   division. An insect cell line (IAL-PID2) established from imaginal discs
   of the Indian meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, with wild-type
   sensitivity to ecdysteroids was used in our study, Our results showed
   that the Plodia cell line exhibited autocrine activity, When division of
   IAL-PID2 cells was synchronized, a rhythmic production of ecdysteroids
   was observed, However, further experiments indicated that this
   rhythmicity could be cell autonomous. This led us to anticipate the
   existence of two cell subpopulations that would be able to produce
   ecdysteroids rhythmically, a minor one that would be cell cycle serum
   independent population, and a major population that would need serum
   growth factors to proliferate and produce ecdysteroids. Qualitative
   study of the ecdysteroid content of the media clearly showed that
   ecdysone was the major immunoreactive product, Taken together, our
   findings clearly show that an insect cell line of epidermal origin is
   capable of rhythmic autocrine production of ecdysteroids. These results
   support the hypothesis that alternate sites for ecdysteroid production
   in vivo may exist and could play a role in local regulation of
   development. We now plan to determine the cellular basis of this
   rhythmic autocrine activity and to confirm the existence of growth
   factor-autonomous cells in the culture as well as the potent role played
   by ecdysteroids in the cross-talk between various cell subpopulations.

Abstract = {{Spatial identification and description of ecological boundaries is
   fundamental to better understanding of treeline dynamics. Ecological
   boundaries across two contrasting subalpine Pinus uncinata forest-alpine
   grassland ecotones were delineated within the Central Pyrenees (Ordesa
   and Tesso sites). Boundaries were delineated using an edge detection
   algorithm for two-dimensional data (lattice-wombling). Tree density,
   size-structure, growth-form, and estimated age were used to reveal
   spatial location of boundaries for several size and growth-form tree
   classes. Overlap statistics were applied to quantify spatial
   relationships among boundaries determined for different sets of
   variables. The most significant and consistent boundaries were those for
   structural variables at the Ordesa site. At this site, the sequential
   disposition of bigger and unistemmed trees descending across the ecotone
   produced boundaries for size-structure and growth-form variables. These
   boundaries were located along an ordered spatial pattern (altitudinal
   diagonal). At the Tesso site, there were few consistent boundaries, most
   of which were developed along the slope. Overlap statistics showed that
   boundaries at the Ordesa site were more spatially related than were
   those at the Tesso site. This result held when any set of variables was
   considered. The studied ecotones describe sharp (Ordesa site) and
   gradual (Tesso site) structural changes in tree populations, related to
   situations similar to the ecotone and eccocline concepts, respectively.
   The possible environmental driving factors producing these patterns are
   the strong winds and reduced snow cover at higher altitudes at the
   Ordesa site, and snow avalanches at the Tesso site. Boundary detection
   through time in permanent plots might be a better tool for monitoring
   climate-change impact in the forest-alpine grassland ecotone than the
   subjective location of treelines.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of waders (Charadrii) on machair habitats on the island of
   South Uist were counted and wader nests were monitored to determine nest
   success and causes of failure. There were large declines in wader
   numbers and nest success following the spread of the introduced hedgehog
   throughout the island. Predation of wader eggs by hedgehogs was
   frequent, but susceptibility varied among wader species, being between 0
   and 60\% of the nests started. Wader species that were susceptible to
   hedgehog predation tended to suffer larger population declines than
   those that were less Susceptible, with the exception that the ringed
   plover (Charadrius hiaticula) population declined markedly even though
   their nests were depredated by hedgehogs infrequently. A combined
   analysis of mark-resighting and radio-tracking data produced an average
   hedgehog population density estimate of 57 adults km(-2) was estimated
   that wader eggs only provided 0.7-5.5\% of the energy requirements of
   hedgehogs, even during the season when most eggs were taken. Prom this
   it is argued that the abundance of hedgehogs and the intensity of their
   predation on wader eggs are unlikely to diminish in response to wader
   population declines. Unless some presently unidentified
   density-dependent mechanism compensates for low nest success, local
   extinctions of susceptible wader species are likely if no action is
   taken to reduce hedgehog predation. This appears to be the first
   documented case of hedgehogs threatening an internationally important
   bird population with regional extinction. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
